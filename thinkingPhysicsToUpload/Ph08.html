<div class="thecontent"><p>The model is useable, but could be refined: you&#39;re looking for significant sets of paths, defined by source, waypoint and detector, where the contributions add to a significant resultant, so predicting a bright point. For other sets of paths, perhaps terminating in a different detector, the contributions don&#39;t add to much, predicting a lack of illumination at that detector. And in principle you&#39;ve to sum these contributions over all possible paths.</p>
<p>There is a very neat way of working with significant groups of paths: working with three paths, as a triplet, is fruitful. More than three adds complexity without adding insight. Where the paths contribute significantly to the resultant, the contributing arrows line up, where there is a very small contribution, they curl up.</p>

<p>In any situation, picking out what&#39;s distinctive about the geometry let&#39;s you see how to explore the space with a triplet.</p>
