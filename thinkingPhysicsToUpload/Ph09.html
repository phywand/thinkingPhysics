<p>If you took out the paths near the end of the mirror, it wouldn&#39;t make so much difference, as the arrows contributed by the triplets of waypoints from those regions tend to curl up. But ignoring the contributions from nearer the centre does make a difference, so a rough and ready rule is that you&#39;ll only need to consider paths where <q class="single">the angle of incidence = the angle of reflection</q>, which is comfortingly familiar.</p>
