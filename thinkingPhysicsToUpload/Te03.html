<p>The third question(<q class="single">By what mechanism?</q>) is not an energy description - it belongs to a different semiotic register - although it may be useful in identifying calculations that might be insightful, and so denote fruitful qualitative descriptions in identifying stores and pathways. That&#39;s the last you&#39;ll see of mechanisms here.</p>
<p>(Because power is about what&#39;s happening, it&#39;s easier to connect to the lived-in world, and perhaps move from thinking about power into discussions of mechanisms. Power and energy might be co-developed, as opportunities for their natural use occur, rather than developing at first one, and then the other.)</p>
