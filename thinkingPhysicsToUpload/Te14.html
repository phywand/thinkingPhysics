<p>Here four steps in developing an energy description map to three levels of description.</p>

<p>The structure of the energy descriptions, which is part of a passage of teaching consists of three levels:</p>
<p>Level one is located in the lived-in world and consists of a description of changes in everyday objects using common terms.</p>
<p>Level two has two complementary halves. The first half is an operationalisation of measures by a process of noticing and recording elements of the lived-in world, bring them into focus so that they can be a part of a physical description. The second half is complementary to this and provides imagined mechanisms which can be a mental model to enable you to get a grip on what is happening during a process( and so provide an explanatory mechanism).</p>
<p>Level three is where the idea of energy gets a grip: it depends on the operationalised measures established in the second level. Still, it does not depend on (a grasp of) – and, complements – the physical mechanisms described in the second level.</p>
<p class="TeacherTip"><strong>Teacher Tip: </strong><q>Best not to try and jump straight to questions about energy changes: it does not end well.</q></p><p class="clear"></p>

<p>Any proposed passage of teaching, which invokes the idea of energy should develop this idea through the levels. Developing an energy description involves working through the levels with your class: don&#39;t jump straight to an account in terms of energy. This structure should reduce difficulties by providing a framework in which talk about energy is much more likely to consist of sensible talk, and not a word game. Try using non-verbal resources to complement the words, as words by themselves are somewhat slippery, and not well suited to introducing children to precise yet abstract ideas.</p>
