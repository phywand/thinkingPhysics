<div class="thecontent"><p>This is a sequence of eight steps, here cast as an imagined learning journey (so with a focus on what the children will be reasoning about and with as they experience the learning journey).</p>
<p>I think there is a reasonable chance that such a narrative line in kinematics could work for a good many children and their teachers in perfectly ordinary classrooms, while supporting the development of fruitful and intelligible styles and patterns of reasoning in physics for children 8-16 years old. There is certainly a lot of evidence that the current widespread approach based on graphs and algebra all in one dimension leaves room for improvement (QuoteThis}). This approach may also throw up issues, but I think there is a good chance that many of the tripwires that afflict the current scheme are removed, and no (apparent) new tripwires laid.</p>
