<p>What now? Well, in one sense, all the hard work is done â€“ the connections between acceleration, velocity and displacement are made, and with due practice, can be secure. The scalar quantities of distance and speed are rather straightforward to introduce with the resources to hand. However, there are bridges to other representations to build: to algebra, to graphical representations.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that you&#39;ll only be dealing with scalars or the magnitudes of the vector quantities, which is why this is perhaps best delayed until after the introduction to kinematics suggested here.</p>
