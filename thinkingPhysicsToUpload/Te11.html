<p>Here the trouble with cause and effect is that it is a story-telling mechanism, and the telling of a story depends on taking a personal point of view: it depends on a narrative structure. Such structures are great for explaining &#39;how something goes&#39; to ourselves but have their limitations, and different story-tellers may choose a different cause. Philosophers have explored such problems down the ages, with Hume being a very significant inflexion point. You could borrow a metaphor from the internet, â€“ often accounts in physics are not best structured as a set of &#39;if this then that&#39; because this relies on many un-explicated necessary conditions. As anyone who codes will realise, there are auxiliary assumptions behind the correct functioning of a piece of code.</p>
<p>To put it another way, any assertion of cause relies on a host of ceteris paribus conditions, which are often unexamined. Physics has developed to be more concerned with the &quot;how&quot; and not with the &quot;why&quot;, so with stating correlations. The relationship a=F/m is of this kind: there is no arrow of time, no before and after, hidden in the assertion of equality. It is not, in short, a causal relationship, at least in the way that story-tellers, and perhaps, therefore, any natural language-users want to use cause and effect. Instead, it is a constraint relationship, describing a possibility space. It and many other relationships in physics have this in common with energy descriptions.</p>

<p>So to try to decide whether acceleration causes force or force causes acceleration is to conflate two different story-telling traditions( and why does no one speak up for mass?).</p>

<p>Similarly, for I=V/R. Maybe it&#39;s worth thinking about why no one even thinks about launching a discussion about cause and effect for the relationship density = mass/volume.</p>
<p>Most relationships in elementary physics are like this, comparing the values of physical quantities before a change with those afterwards and in other words, constraining the possible values between a pair of snapshots.</p>

<p>(These are different from accumulation relationships: there are good arguments for preferring to focus on accumulation relationships in introductory kinematics)</p>
