<div class="thecontent"><h4>Starting out</h4>

<p>First I’d suggest developing the idea of a wave slowly and carefully, with the building blocks as:</p>
<ol>
<li> imitation of what is happening at the source,</li>
<li> after a delay,</li>
<li> depending on distance from the source.</li>
</ol>
<h4>One to many mimics</h4>

<p>Such an episode moves from a single imitator (mimic, copy-cat) to an array of imitators at different distances. These represent the medium, and arranging them regularly gives a recognisable conventional representation of a wave. The gain is that now children know what the component parts are and how they work together to give this overall pattern.</p>

<h4>Different pattens</h4>

<p>Then launch into an episode exploring different patterns of motion in the source, still imposing a delay on the imitators depending on their distance from the source. This is the imperative, expressed as a memorable slogan: ”do like me, but later”. The imitators now show a variety of waveforms, and the sequence reinforces the essential component facets of what it is to be a wave.</p>

<h4>Pulses and packets</h4>

<p>Not all sources vibrate continuously, so launch into the a third episode moving from a single delayed imitation, to pulses, to wave packets, and back to continuous waves.</p>
