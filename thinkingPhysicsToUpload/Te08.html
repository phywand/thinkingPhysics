<p>Well, we now have an image of a description; how can we prepare the ground?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Foregrounding constraint relationships – those which show possibilities and impossibilities – for changes where the quantities are less abstract.
(Showing what is necessary for a sound level two description).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Developing the idea of a trade-off, thus establishing that there may be choices in getting a job done, but there are hard limits to those choices.
(A gentle introduction to conservation laws: not getting something for nothing.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Developing a semi-quantitative description for the calculated stored quantity that is energy (and maybe also a linked version for power).
(Laying up resources for developing a level three description for students whose algebraic and arithmetic competence is limited)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This last one is reasonably well-rehearsed and tested, mainly through the influence of the Supporting Physics Teaching initiative.</p>
