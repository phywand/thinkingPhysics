<h4>Advance organiser: photons modelled with spinning arrows, exploring contributions</h4>

<p>Start with illuminating phenomena to promote noticing and discussion, to motivate the idea of <q class="single">exploring space</q>: the arrangements of the source and what goes in the surrounding space determine the brightness at different locations – so what turns up at the detector. Discuss the space into which the photons are emitted – develop a description from the point of view of the photons, for the photons of what&#39;s out there – that enables you to predict where it&#39;s bright, and where it&#39;s not. This will be the basis of an account of lighting, of illumination, of optics, based on photons.</p>
<p>First do some careful noticing, starting with seeing.</p>
