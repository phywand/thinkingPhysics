<div class="thecontent"><h4>Really simple</h4>

<p>Velocity is often defined as the rate of change of displacement, and acceleration as the rate of change of velocity, and there comes a time along the learning pathway when this conceptually charged formalisation, with its infinitesimals, is an essential part of the physicist&#39;s toolkit. But perhaps not when starting out. Here integration, as simple repetitive addition, seems much more straightforward than subtraction and division, so differentiation. &#39;Acceleration accumulates velocity&#39; ( and the more demotic version, &#39;acceleration tells velocity how to change&#39; is more approachable still, but remains operationally precise. &#39;Acceleration accumulates velocity&#39; is intrinsically a more straightforward formulation than &#39;acceleration is the rate of change of velocity&#39;, as assayed by the number and subtlety of mathematical operations required.</p>
<p>Indeed, numerical methods for solving sets of equations use just such repetitive addition to predict the velocity from a given acceleration, and the displacement from a given velocity. Of course, such predictions are risky: here the velocity as reported by the GPS-enabled device does not guarantee that I&#39;ll end up in the sea and miss Edinburgh, or that I&#39;ll travel directly from the current location, shown by the cross-hairs, to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Either approach must be sensitive to the real situation: in the case of modelling with either rates or with accumulations, the situation determines the interval used for calculations.</p>
<p>This consideration becomes much more persuasive when considering vectors as a part of the didactic mix, as adding vectors can be made rather straightforward by treating them as arrows and doing the addition graphically.</p>
