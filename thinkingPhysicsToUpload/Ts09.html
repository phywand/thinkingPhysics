<p>In this space-times, what could be my gyro-compass, giving directions for Newton first law, for natural motion? How to ‘carry straight on?’ (How to map out the geodisics?) Answer: look at the clocks around me. If they’re all ticking at the same rate, select a roller that marks out equal ticks to my left and right, unspooling duration into displacement, linked by the universal speed.</p>
<p>What to do if the clocks are ticking at different rates: select a different roller, that unspools duration at different rates on different sides. The new natural motion, as a result of differential ticking, is a curve. Space-time is curved.</p>
<p>It there is a greater difference in the ticking, then space-time is more curved: ‘carrying straight on’ leads me on a different path.</p>
<p>To accelerate is to move away from the geodisic.</p>
