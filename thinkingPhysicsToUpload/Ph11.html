<div class="thecontent"><p>Photons don&#39;t even know to <q class="single">travel</q> in straight lines. However if there is nothing between the source and detector, light appears to travel in straight lines. So next you might try looking at lining-up and curling-up for a source and detector with nothing in the space separating them. Again you have to guess – but an intelligent guess – as to the most significant paths and then model that with the triplets.</p>

<p>Here only the contributions from the central area add much to the resultant – contributions from paths with waypoints far from the centre line curl up. Again you have recovered an empirical law: that light travels in straight lines. But once again you now have a theoretical reason why this is the case – it&#39;s no longer just to be accepted as fact.</p>
<p>But there is a wrinkle, which you can explore. It does look as if you can ignore all paths apart from those defined by a hole around the centreline. A commonly fruitful way of thinking in physics is to take things to extremes – so now try making the hole smaller by adding a barrier. In two dimensions on screen that will be a slit.</p>
