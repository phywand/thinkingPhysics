<div class="thecontent"><h4>Plausibility and intelligibility - and energy?</h4>

<p>The image of energy is just a little tarnished. We&#39;ve drifted away from the style and interests the pragmatic thermodynamicists who created the idea of energy (too much &quot;this is definitely right&quot;; &quot;how could you suggest that&quot;). I think we need to recapture some of their intent by considering first to what uses we might put a completed description in terms of energy. In working towards that, there is a kind of choice tree:</p>
<iframe  src="../TPTeDescriptionKindsPID" class="iframe" scrolling="no" style="border: 0" width = "810" height = "550"></iframe>


<p>First off, that energy is a calculated quantity remains a touchstone. Tripwires laid around to deflect from a journey heading towards that idea should be avoided. But it&#39;s not the only calculated quantity, so what&#39;s so special about the idea?</p>
<p>Mechanism and narrative stories are comforting, and a standard explanatory structure. However, energy is a constraint on what&#39;s possible, so stands aside from this narrative structure. However, the lived-in world is, the world of scientific reasoning that we&#39;re trying to account for is in this part, not made from or built of this kind of explanatory structure. (Energy descriptions are not of the form: &#39;First this, then that&#39;, as a causal consequence). The teaching of energy should respect that reality: energy is not the &#39;go of things&#39;. Energy is instead the ultimate &#39;limiting factor&#39;, determining what is and is not possible, so we should show it as such.</p>
<p>&quot;How?&quot; unpacks to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;How much?&quot;;</li>
<li>&quot;At what rate?&quot;;</li>
<li>&quot;By what mechanism?&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first question is about energy, and so about augmenting and depleting a stored quantity (find energy in stores). The second is about power, therefore a quantity that&#39;s defined when a process is happening(find power in pathways). Both these questions require calculated quantities, so depend on a clear description of a physical change or process.</p>
