StepHeader{Photons, power, compensation}

Photons are quantum entites, shifting energy to or from stores in discrete amounts. So simply counting the number of JustUnit{photons second -1} sets the power in the beam, for a particular frequency of photon.

The activity (which is the number of JustUnit{photons second -1}) at the source and detector set the power absorbed and emitted.

Varying the frequency of the photon sets the energy shifted by each photon: the activity and the frequency together characterise what is QuoteThis{seen}.

So varying the activity and the frequency might be expected to determine the power.

And the activity and frequency are compensated quantities â€“ a useful and repreating pattern to think of whenever considering power or energy.

Power in a pathways can be switched to another pathway by a device, here the source, absorber and detector are all devices, making the link with teaching about energy and power.

By varying the materials between source and detector you can model macroscopic behaviours (Engineering the space between source and detector).

Get an interesting (exponential) pattern from iserting successive slices of absorber between source and detector. There is an exponential relationship between acticities, the powers absorbed, and the powers transmitted.
