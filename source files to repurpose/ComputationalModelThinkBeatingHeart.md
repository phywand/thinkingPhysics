WebTitle{Modelling—the beating heart of physics}

### a heartbeat

Good physics makes good pictures of the world. At their best these are responsive, either evolving once started by their creator—predicting what does and what does not change over time, or laying down QuoteThis{the law}, showing the possibilities and impossibilities in any situation as it is explored by the creator.

Comparing these created pictures with the real world decides their value. A good match and you have done a good piece of physics. That is, the imaginary world mimics the lived-in world. But it is only a functional mimicry: modelling has to be selective, as with any map-making.

This creative process can be hugely satisfying and computational modelling activities can be designed to allow children this pleasure. If so, children should be inventing and writing the rules to define what the model does, including making valuable mistakes. As with any open-ended activity, the skilful teacher guides progress through the activity, so that lessons can be learnt from false starts, and successes of many kinds appropriately celebrated.

Computational modelling tools can be used by the teacher to guide more convergent activities, constructing a pre-practised model with the class, or even to source or prepare a particular model before the lesson starts. Even at this end of the spectrum of use, there are choices to be made. With the completed model you can explore just the inputs and outputs, so using the modelling tool to produce simulations, or explore the structure of the thinking represented in the model with the class, so having a powerful and public way of sharing your thinking.

As its essence, a modelling tool provides a set of tools for expressing your own thinking, so making that thinking clear, especially to yourself. The kit-set of pieces and the ways in which they interact are made explicit: ambiguity is reduced. You need to be explicit about both your reasoning and about the representations with which you choose to reason: two hugely significant facets of modelling.

Computed worlds supplement word processing and drawing diagrams as a more dynamic way of expressing yourself with the computer: a modelling tool provides carefully controlled access to a wide range of expressive powers. So now you, and the children you teach, can create and share your own narratives.

# A choice in how you approach modelling

### - A traditional modelling approach

- imagine some variables
- write down some algebra
- set some initial values for the variables
- run the system of equations
- inspect the output (usually as a scatter graph), sometimes just as a table
- translate this into an imaginable and intelligible form, to compare with the phenomena

This approach imposes a high imaginative load. You are expecting children to link the abstract algebra with the phenomena, often mediated by another abstract representation: the scatter graph.

A more gradual approach to build up a model, by constructing interactive diagrams, physics interactive diagrams(PID). This approach may, by virtue of presenting a more gradual path to abstraction, and staying close to the physical situation for longer, provide a more fruitful route.

### The PID approach

- create representations of the phenomenon, setting values where appropriate
- place those representations on a canvas, to re-describe what you notice and record
- Focus on the physical relationships, expressed through the evolving behaviour of the representations
- write rules about connections between the representations and how they evolve over time

### Comparing approaches

- one of these approaches gives you objects to think with that are closely connected to physical descriptions to think about early only
- one of these gives feedback which is connected to things you might notice

For here on in, we're going to suggest a gradualist approach, based on generating interactive diagrams.


# Choosing and using representations

### Examples from SPT
Here is one simple situation where you move from a physical situation through to representations which are quantitative and yet still connected clearly to measurements that might be made. The current arrow is clearly connected to flow and the magnitude of the arrow increases as the flow increased. The potential difference representation is clearly connected to the act of placing a voltmeter across an object and yet can show the magnitude of the potential difference.   this presents a representation which is much closer to the physical than writing down a number and a unit or else a single symbol (V or I).

Here is another situation where you move from a depiction of everyday objects the lived-in world through to an austere imagined physics world by using standardised representations.

InsertGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTWebGraphics/FoForcesNotObviousEPSC.svg}

### Deploying representations in a modelling tool
These kinds of first steps towards generating a  computational model can now be made using a modelling tool. The physics diagram language which enables physics interactive diagrams has building blocks, or primitives, which produce all of the standardised representations used in Supporting Physics Teaching.  So it's possible to build up a model using a sequence of steps.

Here's the standard example of modelling free fall: a skydiver.

You might start by discussing the forces on the skydiver, and how these combine to produce a resultant force. However, rather than starting with an algebraic statement you might start with the manipulable arrows:

{\>\>find and adapt\<\<}

InsertGraphic{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ MoAddingForcesSupport}

This is no more than an interactive diagram — there are no rules about connecting the forces or relating the forces to the duration of the fall.   Instead, it's a place where you can begin to discuss what children's expectations are.

A fairly traditional approach to developing a model of this situation is to create a series of snapshots in which you look at the forces acting on the skydiver, the resultant force, and the acceleration that results.  Again this is possible that the same tool:

{\>\>find and adapt\<\<}

InsertGraphic{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ MoJourneyStepsSupport}

You could use the tool to create a partial model of the situation that calculates the resultant force from the forces acting.  doing so would be to where the first rule at your imagined world.

{\>\>find and adapt\<\<}

InsertGraphic{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/MoForceSumSupport}

You might then look at the relationship between acceleration and velocity, as one of simple accumulation.

{\>\>find and adapt\<\<}

InsertGraphic{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/MoTheAccumulationSupport}

Finally, and perhaps several steps in the future, you might show a fully developed model.

{\>\>find and adapt\<\<}

InsertGraphic{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/MoFreefallGraphVectorThread}

### A choice to make
Developing a full-blown model, such as the skydiver, is quite an undertaking and involves many steps. Making the steps visual and explicit can help children to follow the steps and to see what those steps are — that is to open the steps up for reflection: to reflect on their own theorising. In this way, children can come to see what the process of modelling is, and to see some of the procedural moves that are useful. This can be combined with the graphical language for displaying the moves provide a complete package for representing modelling.

# Modeling is a process for which you have to choose tools

### The process
Modelling is all about creating representations with which one can reason.  At their best these are responsive: dynamic if accounting for changes over time, or explorable if representing a process. It has for some years been possible to create computational representations of facets of the physics that we teach. Here I'll explore what might be done to support current curricular modelling statements and see how to evolve the current practice.

Comparing these models with the real world decides their value. A good match and you have done a good piece of science. This can be hugely satisfying. Activities with modelling software are designed to allow children this pleasure. So they should be writing the rules to define what the system does.

### The tools
Modelling tools are, in their essence, exercises in intelligible design. That is, they carry messages about what they represent in their structure and affordances. Since modelling is about doing the QuoteThis{mostest with the leastest} — at least in physics, it follows that the tool itself can usefully proscribe some possibilities.

In essence, modelling tools should be lean and focussed on making available (and salient) the pre-eminent modes of reasoning. Furthermore,  the design of the tool should minimise the chances of syntactic errors.

ThinkHeader{Some simple ideas about an evolving system}

- when representing the evolution over time, something obviously happens during that time
- the imagined, created world needs to evolve by itself, without interventions
- in elementary physics, there are a limited set of evolutions over time, and  these are mostly kinematics (one dimension:p-\>v, a-\>v, a-\>v-\>p;  two dimensions: parabolic and circular motions)
- Do...while a certain condition holds (doWhile functions) are a fundamental iterating structure, because:
	- iterating forever to an infinite future is very risky (so, no-keeping-on-going forever)
	- processes often also need terminating conditions other than a certain duration

ThinkHeader{Some simple ideas about a constrained system}

- no evolution in time, only an exploration of constraint relationships, so of possibilities and of impossibilities 
- the properties of geometric figures to reason about some such relationships

### How to choose a particular tool

ThinkHeader{Criteria for being interesting}

- the range of processes or situations that you and the children can express with the tool
- the range of partial and completed models that are intelligible enough to share
- similar patterns of thinking should be visibly rendered as such
- it should be possible to view the big picture, rather than getting mired in technicalities

ThinkHeader{Questions about pedagogy}

- what exactly are the milestones and possible paths on the learning journey?
- how can you manage the learning journey?
- affordances  and resistances of the chosen system
- there should be an element of mild surprise or pleasure obtained when the model runs
- children's ideas should be implementable in different ways: modelling should be an open activity

### Selecting and managing modelling tools
ThinkHeader{ Just what are modelling tools for?}

You might start by looking for either
- pedagogic utility
or
-  and well-established teaching models
as these are a primary concern if trying to change practice, whereas philosophical verisimilitude is probably less of a concern.

Here is fruitful thought: QuoteThis{what we think of as real is what we use to act on the world}. That is interventions are central to our idea of what is real. The representational facilities of modelling tools can be exploited to make a wider range of entities manipulable and therefore real.

As far as learning  is concerned you'll be  looking for something that'll be:

- plausible
- fruitful
- intelligible

but you also need to bring in the importance of immediately accessible affordances as an encouragement to improvise and explore further.

In this respect what does modelling have to learn from coding?

ThinkHeader{Essentials for considering a modelling system}

- there should be a range of situations or processes that can be expressed with the tool, in ways that support the learning of physics
- a range of partial and completed models can be shared with pupils that are intelligible, can be explored and developed
- an element of mild surprise or pleasure should be obtained when the model runs—not only 'just what was expected'
- there should be a successful attempt to minimise the syntactic errors by the cunning design of the expressive medium

ThinkHeader{Strategic decisions to do with managing the modelling process}

- how to show the big picture whilst modelling—the zoomed-out view that keeps the aim of the whole in sight whilst we're wrestling with the minutiae
- how to make the same pattern of thinking visible, across many contexts (search and replace in code is a valuable tool in this regard)
- how to implement the same model in different expressive media to help with abstraction
- how to foreground the re-useable parts of the learning journey as the model is developed?
- plan to have to hand a range of techniques for managing the learning journey - placing of milestones and signposting of (multiple) pathways?
- how to exploit the affordances of the system in which implement the modelling

ThinkHeader{Reflections on two kinds of variables based modelling system}

There are two kinds of models, or at the very least two modes of thought,  that relate physical quantities, and it's important to distinguish between them, for rather fundamental reasons.

These are models that relate quantities that accumulate and models that relate quantities that are constrained. In the former case, the physical quantities evolve with time, and in the latter, they do not.

Physics is replete with atemporal relationships between physical quantities:

FractionCBA{QuantitySymbol{a}}{QuantitySymbol{F}}{QuantitySymbol{m}}

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}

FractionCBA{density}{mass}{volume}

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{F}}{QuantitySymbol{G}QuantitySymbol{M}QuantitySymbol{m}}{SymbolSuper{r}{2}}

These are all true at an instant (any instant). There's no essential temporal variation. You might think of them as 'QuotationThis{snapshot} relationships: describing possibilities; proscribing impossibilities. With such a view, other relationships are also of this kind:

ProductABC{QuantitySymbol{v}}{QuantitySymbol{a}}{QuantitySymbol{t}}

and

SumABC{QuantitySymbol{s}}{QuantitySymbol{u} MultipliedBy QuantitySymbol{t}}{WordFraction{1}{2} MultipliedBy QuantitySymbol{a} MultipliedBy SymbolSuper{t}{2}}

Here QuantitySymbol{t} stands for the time on the clock. (There's rather a lot of advice about being careful about time in the literature, usually focussed on the teaching of kinematics, but you ought to keep it in mind in all areas of teaching so that you can represent the coherence of physics well). Such a QuoteThis{time-on-clock} is also known as QuotationThis{an instant}.

Laurence Viennot has written extensively and convincingly about a tendency of children to interpret these kinds of relationships in terms of stories with a timeline. A favourite example is:

ProductABCD{QuantitySymbol{P}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{n}  MultipliedBy QuantitySymbol{R}}{QuantitySymbol{T}}

This is a relationship between macroscopic variable, true at every instant, so a canonical QuoteThis{snapshot} relationship, where the physical quantities are constrained. Perhaps because humans seek causes, and tell ourselves explanatory stories in terms of these causes, we tend to reason with this kind of relationship in terms of QuoteThis{first one quantity changes, then this changes the next, so the final quantity remains constant}. The important point here is that there is no QuoteThis{then} as a consequent action: it's a snapshot relationship. Much discussion of how to present Newton's third law would be clarified by selective attention to this atemporal or instantaneous constraining.

So in modelling, we ought to respect the difference between constraining and accumulating models. Accumulations ought to be about evolution over time, and so you'd be able to iterate over time. Other models that do not involve such accumulations ought to steer clear of iterations altogether. Here's an example where you could iterate (that is the modelling system permits it – and it's slick) but one ought not to, and if your aim is present the tool as something which exposes the thinking in a rather fundamental and helpful way. The example is the maximum power dissipated in a load drawdrawdrawResistor(QuantitySymbol{R})in a circuit where the  cell has an internal resistance(QuantitySymbol{r}). This might not be importantly all if using the modelling tool as a construction kit for building simulations, where the engine is probably hidden. But here I'm discussing a modelling tool as an expressive medium, so the maximum power theorem and similar relationships are better not expressed as accumulation relationships.

ThinkHeader{Linking the two kinds of thinking and expression}

- In practice both kinds of relationships turn up in physics models, sometimes in the same model.
- Models with evolution gives time traces of trajectories through phase space and, when frozen, give geometric figures (e.g. a graph - this is could then be explored by a constraint model). There is some thinking and research to be done on the extent to which it is, in general, possible to exploit the properties of geometric figures to review relationships.
- So you could run an accumulating model, then freeze the output: then constraints modelling can be used to look back at frozen stream (This looks like a two step process of generating and then inspecting). Typically this is what data analysis programs do: represent a stream of data as a geometrical object, and then use tools to analyse it. I'm not aware of any that use any geometrical object other than a scatterplot. To restrict the output of accumulating models to this kind of inspection of output makes them seem less like live evolving systems.
- There remains an issue of how to represent the two kinds of relationships in identifiably different ways, particularly if within the same model.

### Four issues in current modeling tools
ThinkHeader{Algebra and the equals sign}

The main user issue for teachers in using Modellus appears to be writing F= m \* dv/dt, and suchlike, rather than starting the line with the differential, so writing dv/dt = F/m.

The issue is this. Users first expect '=' to be a mathematical equality. So dp/dt=F and F=dp/dt are exactly equivalent in their minds. But in Modellus, as in many or most modeling packages, the "=" is an assignment ( it can be parsed as 'let the value of dp/dt= F'.

This is an example where Modellus does not speak mathematics, but rather some language of its own, which is related to maths but is not maths. And it's quite a stylised language : a kind of pseudo-code.

ThinkHeader{Elegantly terminating a run}

There is  already a do-while: it's in the iteration. Iterate these series of equations while the time is less than a certain value. In introducing Modellus, or similar modeling systems to the low-density user (so not the keen / addicts/ etc) I believe that thinking about the internal dialogue (how the user is construing what the system is doing) is all-important. This is so for all software, of course, but especially so for modeling software, which has to be written to optimise the expression of  intelligible ideas.

There are many uses for a more general do..while construction, that assume time ticks along in the background.

A braking model, say, where the iterations stop when the kinetic energy is zero. Or parabola, when the ground is struck, or a wall is hit, etc.

So here's a simple story, including the natural need for a do-while.

I'm after how long it takes to come to a stop. I know how much energy is in my kinetic store. The power empties the kinetic store. The clock ticks on. Keep emptying the store until there's nothing left.

Currently this gets turned into:

			=>
			E=12
			P=-7
			dE/dt=P

Or:

			=>
			E=12
			P=-7
			E = last (E)+P*Dt

So it's a simple model. But currently there is no elegant ways in many modeling systems to terminate the run on some condition. I think we can do better.

ThinkHeader{Constraint modeling}

Plotters in Modellus, for example, draw squiggly lines when you manipulate the model, even if not iterating.  (its a pity that that this is not explicitly obvious to the user, as constraint modeling turns out to be rather important). At the moment I see no elegant way of starting a new manipulation  with no history of squiggles all over the plotters.

That is constraining is implemented, but not presented clearly. It needs to be more explicit, as it is so important.

So I can write a model which explores maximum power output

			V=E-I*r
			I=E/r+R
			P=V*I

Iterating over R to explore multiple conditions, using the same control mechanism as for iterating over time is asking for trouble: you're encouraging conflation of two very different modes of reasoning.

Modellus has an issue in separating models that evolve from those that constrain: too much mathematics & too little physics. Or, put another way, too much Leibniz and too little Newton.


# Accumulating or constraining

### Processes (evolutions) or situations (states)
For many processes studied in classical physics we think we've acquired some understanding of the process when we can write down a fixed deterministic rule  that describes how the process evolves:  what future state (there is only one — that's determinism) follows from the current state.

The paradigm for much of this aspiration is the dynamical system of Newtonian mechanics. The rule of evolution for this dynamical system is a set of relationships that link the state now to the state a short time in the future, given as differential  or difference equations. To determine the states for all future times just keep iterating the relation many times: advancing step by step by step.

Processes evolve through accumulations.

There are a few relationships like this in elementary physics, but only a few. Many do not specify how a state will evolve into another: they are not concerned with specifying how a situation evolves over time—a process—rather they are concerned with relationships between different quantities in a given situation. These situations are more formally referred to as states.

A state quantity or state variable is a property of a situation that depends only on what's the case now, not on how that situation was reached, or even where it will go next. In thermodynamics a state variable describes the equilibrium state of a system—for example, thermal energy. These are atemporal relationships, as there is no evolution over time: indeed no first one, then another.

Relationships that predict changes in quantities over processes are accumulations(quantities with accumulations: QWA): those that relate quantities in situations are constraints(quantities with constraints: QWC).

### Fundamentally different connections between quantities
ThinkHeader{Accumulating}

QWA is all about fluxions: about changes over time. Newton was deeply interested  in change over time.  His invention of the calculus enabled a more precise description of how quantities changed over time: how they accumulated in either a positive or negative sense. The accumulating  quantity Newton called a  fluent, the quantity which set the accumulations a fluxion. These quantities  were central to his publication: "The Method of Fluxions".

To enable children to work with changes over time I think we might well gain from a return to this concern of tracking the change of a single quality through time. We could imagine mapping this onto a fluent-space, or fSpace. This would be similar to a sparkline, popularised by Tufte, as a common way of tracking quantities over time.

ThinkHeader{Graphs and Accumulations}

Accumulations are all about change, not about the accumulated effect, so there is a focus in CMR on watching representations of quantities evolve over time, rather looked back on a process that has happened.

Conventional scatter graphs are frozen rivers, perhaps recording what happened to the fluents and the fluxions, and invite geometrical rather than fluxion-based reasoning.

ThinkHeader{Constraining}

Constraints are all about possibility spaces. In a situation, or state, it's often the case that discoveries have been made about the values that different quantities can have: not every quantity can have any values—there are constraints. There are two facets to establish in introducing the discovery:

* that quantities are constrained
* how the quantities are constrained

Representing these relationships with a scatter graph is a geometrisation of 'If this then that'(IFTT), or a "game of consequences": the constraint relationships define the possibility space.  Here I'll prefer the phrase "possibility space" to "consequence space" as it reduces any tendency to think of time flowing as the consequences evolve (similarly, I'd go light on comparison with IFTT as this is (currently) a temporal, causal  internet service). It is the case that these kinds of relationship are most common in introductory physics, and least often explicitly modelled, perhaps because nothing happens by itself, and it is quite hard computationally.

This could be a very useful precursor to thinking about energy as this also defines possibility spaces (and impossibility spaces,  by analogy to the art world's figure and ground—you just cannot go there), although these are more extensive. It's maybe an introduction to phase space, as well.

### A final open question
There are two different kinds of programming languages:

- functional programming, of which Mathematica and the Wolfram Computable Language might stand as examples
- and procedural programming, of which Python and Scratch might stand as examples

Much of the talk of coding in schools focusses on procedural thinking,  and this maps well onto evolutionary models, that represent processes, but perhaps do not do so well with those that represent situations. I think that there is space for further development here.


# Making accumulating models

## Accumulating and processes
In this mode you can make models that  accumulate over time: that is involve rates of change. The foundation idea is that accumulations (numerical  integration) is rather simple—just like stacking up Cuisinaire rods, and so fundamentally based on addition. However differentation, and all that talk of rates of  change and definitions such as

FractionCBA{QuantitySymbol{a}}{dQuantitySymbol{t}}{dQuantitySymbol{v}}

can be rather off-putting.

You are working in this quadrant of the modeling space:

URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTNCPoVGraphics/modelSpaceAccumulate.svg}

SymbolLinebreak

This is well trodden ground, and has been since Nuffield A level introduced paper and pencil methods for numerical integration and then the DMS system arrived on the BBC Micro in 1987. Modellus developed these ideas further, and was integrated into Advancing Physics. Stella, Coach and other 'stocks and flows' based modeling systems, based on systems dynamics thinking, follow a parallel path, and some are devotees.

In elementary physics there are rather few accumulating relationships, although some lie at the heart of difficulties with kinematics, which is all about such accumulations.

Using a  triangle to suggest an accumulation—a visual reminder that one quantity changes another with time—you could write:

QuantitySymbol{a}—▲—QuantitySymbol{v} (QuoteThis{QuantitySymbol{a} tells QuantitySymbol{v} how to grow})

QuantitySymbol{v}—▲—QuantitySymbol{x} (QuoteThis{QuantitySymbol{v} tells QuantitySymbol{x} how to grow})

(coded as v+=a, x+=v). That's kinematics.

Time does not appear here, because it is a Newtonian universe, where the universal time is ticking away in the background, and we're dealing with processes (which  necessarily evolve over time).

Add some more, such as

power—▲—energy

current—▲—charge

activity—▲—number

and you are essentially done. So the trick is to make it also appear to be that simple, and yet remain accessible.

In the imagined worlds rendered as computational models something happens on screen as the process unfolds, so there is both feedback and the chance to explore consequences. You can alter the rules and the initial conditions and  see the effects, rather than having to conjure all of them up by a heroic act of the imagination .

So let's look at a completed model, rather than building one up by stages:

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVBrakingAccumulate.pde}

The physics here is both visible and simple:

			a = fRetard / mass;
			v += a;

Accumulations can also be negative...

Some accumulations are so common that you might want something quicker. Here is one that accumulates all of the dynamical and kinematic quantities:

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVDynKinPreBuiltAccumulate.pde}

The secret is all in the code, and here there is not much. The trick is to isolate the physics and represent it in ways that offer an appropriate reasoning tool for the children. And a tool that they can use, not just look at.

### Back to SPT
This idea of accumulating relationships has been in SPT for a while, and, for those of you who prefer a more visual, but less flexible and more limited modeling environment, there has been a live system:

URLLinkPN{The QWA tool}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/tools/QWA}

for a while.

### Even further back
If you prefer something more flexible, but still graphical, there is

URLLinkPN{VnR}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/tools/VnR/VnR2.0.zip}

(this one is a downloadable java app), where the idea of accumulations probably originated as QuoteThis{grow like me}.


# Making constraint models

## Constraining and situations
In this mode you can make models that represent situations rather than processes.

You are working in this quadrant of the modeling space:

URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTNCPoVGraphics/modelSpaceConstraint.svg}

### Assertions of equality
Let's start with a simple situation: comparing the impulse with the change in momentum.  Here's a simple model which has the two quantities, and allows you to vary their values by dragging. But there are no rules in the imagined world: there are no rules connecting the two quantities:

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVImpulseMometumUnconstrain.pde}

There are deep reasons for thinking that these two will always have identical values, that is both the numerical values and the units will be equal.

EqualityAssertion{WordFraction{number for impulse}{unit for impulse}}{WordFraction{number for change in momentum}{unit for change in momentum }}

That is, the two are constrained. Vary the impulse and you necessarily alter the change the momentum **and** vary the change in momentum and you necessarily alter the impulse. It is a genuine assertion of equality, not an assertion of assignment.

QuoteThis{EqualityAssertion{change in momentum}{impulse}}

Is identical in meaning to

QuoteThis{EqualityAssertion{impulse}{change in momentum}}

(There is evidence that this is not how children read and use the equals symbol, and that this distorts their understanding of the snapshot-like nature of situations: so the distinction is important in teaching physics).

Fortunately we can model this. Here is a constrained pair: they go up and down together. Drag either to vary the value and the other alters.

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVImpulseMometumConstrain.pde}

You can present this as either an empirical discovery about the world, or an a priori truth: but whichever way you look at it, it's a  rather significant and reliable relationship. So worth treating with respect—it was a hard won discovery.

This is a rather simple example,  and there are many constrained relationships in elementary physics—perhaps most of them.  Here is a categorisation:

URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTNCPoVGraphics/ConstraintRelationshipscommented.png}

### Equality with three terms
Let's start with an old chestnut.

FractionCBA{QuantitySymbol{a}}{QuantitySymbol{F}}{QuantitySymbol{m}}

But respecting the insights into the abuse of the equals sign, perhaps exacerbated by the use of QuoteThis{triangles}, let's represent these three quantities, at first in an  model where there are no rules.

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVFmaUnconstrain.pde}

You might not like the arrangement of the representations here—the force is not exerted on the mass—but it suited me to arrange it to match the relationship above. If you object strongly enough , adapt the code(EFTR).

Now you could add some rules into the imagined world, representing the discovery that *a*, *F* and *m* are bound together in a permanent relationship. Here the mass is kept constant, so that you can explore the effect of one independent variable on one dependent variable, again by dragging.

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVFmaConstrain.pde}

If you' d like to change the quantity that is locked, adapt the code.

Again, whether an empirical discovery about the world, or an a priori truth: another  rather significant and reliable relationship. It's not just a calculating device: it's a relationship between important quantities in the physics world.

### Exploring possibilities
Constraining is all about exploring what could or could not be the case in a situation. Some possibilities are ruled out, because of the rules that we've learnt to be reliable guides to action (the 'laws 'of physics). So you could make a bit of a fuss about this, exploring first the possible values when the quantities are unconstrained, and then the possibilities when the quantities  are  constrained. Here the model is for the constrained version, but you have only to comment out (prepend //), or delete the constraining relationship to  strip out the rule.

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVFaConstrainPossibility.pde}

So we got back to linear graphs, but by an insightful route.

But you might prefer something simpler, and more pre-packaged, in which case you could work with something like this:

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVaFmPrepackaged.pde}

### Four terms, and compensation
Constraints apply to many different relationships, not just to two- and three-term relationships: some you'd expect to come across appear in the categorisation above.

Compensated circuits, as here:

FrameNugget{Ee03TAnugget01}

and transformers are two applications where you'd want to model something like:

ProductABCD{SymbolSub{I}{1}}{SymbolSub{V}{1}}{SymbolSub{I}{2}}{SymbolSub{V}{2}}

So create the quantities and then constrain them, to give a model:

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVVIVICompensate.pde}

Here you can drag both currents to set the values, but neither pd.  That allows you to have one independent and one dependent variable. To change these, grab the code and alter the model.

### Back to SPT
This idea of constraint relationships has been in SPT for a while, and, for those of you who prefer a more visual, but less flexible and more limited modeling environment, there has been a live system

URLLinkPN{The QWC tool}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/tools/QWC}

for a while.

### Even further back
If you prefer something more flexible, but still graphical, there is

URLLinkPN{VnR}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/tools/VnR/VnR2.0.zip}

(this one is a downloadable java app), although its metaphor does not do such a good job on constraining.


# A workable classroom taxonomy

Building a workable account of doing physics through building models with which we can reason and represent  might seem more like botany or a social science than physics. A useful output is a workable taxonomy: workable because simple enough to be useable on the fly in the classroom. That means it'll probably not be comprehensive and incontestable: the taxonomy be a field guide, rather than a full and comprehensive account of doing physics. But that's not to say that it should not respect insights from the history and philosophy of physics, albeit re-wrought by didactical transposition.

Here is a simple grid, suitable for thinking about the range of models that might be simple enough to use in the classroom:

 SpacingLinebreak 
The key element is to recognise some of the common moves that you make in constructing models, and to represent these in ways that make their commonality evident across many topics. This is a part of the project of introducing children to the culture of physics, of thinking like a physicist, so that they can know what that is like: both the pleasures and pains.

Many of these moves will be in generating the enabling descriptions that allow the more formal models to get a grip on the world. These are often the difficult foothills, where the path is not clear, and many fall by the wayside. Careful route planning across this terrain, by well prepared guides,  can engender sufficient confidence for repeat transits,  SpacingLinebreak necessarily associated with any effective problem-solving that involves modelling. So an effective approach to modelling starts a long time before writing the first (formal) model.

So what are these moves that we make, and how can we flag them up in ways that make the pervasiveness of the moves evident?

Noticing and recording are two groups of moves, but are perhaps too general as useful field guides. Although you might draw attention to the actions, after suitable priming.

'What do we choose to notice here?'
'What will it be useful to record here? And why?'

'Noticing' is a careful, but pre-physics-theoretic, activity, that results in qualitative or semi-quantitative results. So you can notice speeds and distances. You cannot notice accelerations, velocities, displacements (Forces could be either, depending where you are along the spectrum of refining the idea, because of their psychogenesis in human action).

Here is a workable framework:

* something that replaces my personal action ArrowRight a noticing
* something quantitative that you create through the action of an intra-subjective ontology  ArrowRight  a recording

In either case you can emphasise both selection and choice: depicting the lived-in world is a creative and purposeful activity. If there is a meta-message here, it's that the end goal, or purpose needs to be in view. You can guide children more easily, without many becoming dispirited in the foothills, if you share the reasons for the choice of path, and keep the end goal in sight, or at least in mind. It's an exercise in avoid ing both 'Are we nearly there yet?' And 'Why are we here?'. Pacing and generating a sense of purpose and progress are all: this can, and probably should, be done with a light touch.

More granular moves are therefore easier to stage, as progress is visible. Here are a few suggestions.

We can imagine making progress in the construction of a model by one of only four kinds of moves, effecting:

* a re-description of a situation or process
* a step through an analysis of a situation or process
* an evolution of a process
* an intervention in a situation

For classroom use, you could translate these to a simpler language, or even represent the moves graphically:

Redescriptions, represented with:

URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTRepresentations/RedescribeH.svg}

ArrowRight QuoteThis{see it another way}

Transitioning from one step to the next, represented with:

URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTRepresentations/NextStep.svg}

ArrowRight QuoteThis{next you can}

Self-willed time evolution  represented with:
URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTRepresentations/EvolveR.svg}

ArrowRight QuoteThis{let it run on by itself}

An intervention, denoting a physical changes represented with:

URLGraphic{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/SPTRepresentations/PhysicalR.svg}

ArrowRight QuoteThis{make a change}

The advantages of using a graphical language is that you can use it as a frame for the particular content, which is the approach taken in SPT. The focus can either be on the frame, or on the particular.

But the number of kinds of move, and the way these moves are represented, are choices for you to make. SPT gives one worked through example. What you should not do, I think, is leave the whole process of constructing models as an amorphous set of hidden moves, not explicitly identified and so made available for reflection. It's hard to see how a cultured view of a citizens education in thinking like a physicist could not contain these structuring elements. Tacit knowledge is not enough for a citizen's education in physics.

# Representing foundational thinking in pdl

### Descriptions and transitions
Following on from developing a working taxonomy you can work with two kinds of descriptions of situations: of the lived-in, or physical world, and of the imagined, or conceptual world.  Four kinds of transitions move from one situation to another. These are simply common pattern from the examples discussed earlier.

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVruminatePanesTransitions.pde}

Note: all of the diagrams on this page are computed: that is created with the expressive modeling tool.

### Developing descriptions
As you explicitly develop a way of representing a phenomenon, so as to provide a courteous reasoning path for the children, it may help to represent the moves you make along the way, from one state of the description to another.

Here are a few possibilities, again all generated with code. It would, of course, be possible to encapsulate the code for these, to allow for simpler creation, should they prove to be used.

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVTransitionsCRC.pde}

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVTransitionsPEP.pde}

URLCMR{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/PoVFiles/PoVTransitionsPIP.pde}

Diagrams of any complexity can be built up, providing an overview of an argument, and both written and graphical content can appear in the boxes. Many such diagrams, showing the moves made in representing and reasoning about  phenomena appear in the main SPT materials. That's because SPT takes the view that thinking physics, that  is actually doing physics, is something to seek to enable  in the classroom, rather than an itemisation of the fixed discoveries of  physics.

WebTitle: Modeling for communicating physics

### Three roles for modeling in teaching and learning physics

* Exploratory: Something  pre-built is then explored by children who learn from seeing how someone put it together.
* Expressive: Children build something and learn from the experience of creating, and reflecting on that process.
* Metaphorical: Children reflect on experiences with models to see that is just how physics divvys the world up: a realistic view of the building blocks of physics in action.

### Models and analogies
There are two widely used and contested terms that almost need stipulative definitions to be useful:  model and analogy.

Whenever I use the term model I will be expecting some add kind of similitude between the model and what is modelled that relies on a functional mimicry. I may not always find it, as not all models are successful, but this is the criterion for what it is to be a model. That is the behaviour of the model must catch some essence of the behaviour of what is modelled. It is not enough just to look like what is modelled, so for example a plastic ear would not count an example of a model, in the sense that I will use the word.

An analogy I'll take to be something different. It too relies on a certain similitude between the source and the target of the analogy, but does not require a functional mimicry. Analogies are often use in an illustrative way and are commonly used to render phenomena believable or more acceptable, so enabling a psychological connection with the phenomena. Lacking functional mimicry as an essential component, analogies cannot be used to make reliable predictions.

Both models and analogies in these senses have a role in physics education, but those functions are not interchangeable: I think the distinction is worth preserving so that we can be clear about what the learning outcomes are.

### Artefacts to reason with
Models are  best thought of as artefacts to reason with, and only secondarily as objects to reason about. This secondary use is the metaphorical use of models, which maybe the most frequent use in learning physics, but to make it effective you'd  expect to draw on experience with real models. If there is no such real experience, it's like expecting children to learn about magnets without ever having to handle a magnet, and few would expect to achieve that.

To the extent that they are objects the reason with, computational models are the mirrors of the original mental models of Johnson-Laird. These are public depictions of systems which can be run forward in 'time' to see how such systems behave. This is exactly what a mental model as envisaged by Johnson-Laird is:  a system  you can run forward in your imagination in order to see how things evolve. In a real sense computational models function as prosthetics for this kind of mental model, allowing you to offload some of the processing and some of the memorising so as to enable you to achieve more than you would unaided.

The model is much more than just a picture, or  a three-dimensional simalcrum (or even 4-dimensional).  You expect to be interact with the model, and to be in control.

Even with the idea of model as functional mimic established, there are subdivisions: there are both teaching models and physics models. Pedagogical practitioners use the former: research practitioners use the latter. A carefully reasoned didactical articulation between the two kinds of models ensures that the cultural artefact of physics is a reality shared by the users of both kinds of models.

Interacting with models necessarily enables some kind of computing, allowing the space of possibilities inherent in the model to be explored, so making predictions. In computational modeling, we offloaded the processing to the computer: in mental modeling, unless you have an imperial computer such as Kepler to hand, it happens in our own wetware. In both cases there is no necessity that the computation is fully quantified: making semi-quantitative predictions is something of the mark of expert, and so we should respect the use of models that facilitate this kind of output. After all, topic-based educational research shows that it's the qualitative and semi-quantitative understandings that are hardest to develop accurately, and are also at most lasting value in solving problems in new and unfamiliar situations.

### A spectrum, with possible practices baked into structure
ThinkHeader{An animation, to visualise}

* The depiction of some process.
* This could be just moving pictures or a moving illustration, and could be a cartoon.

You might use these for situations where QuoteThis{teachers just knows what happens}, but rendering this via a tractable mathematical model is just too hard. Maybe you could also  usefully deploy animations to encourage thinking about counterfactual situations, or QuoteThis{emphasised seeing}, as a kind of visual attention director,  often from an unlikely angle.

ThinkHeader{A simulation, to depict}

* These are calculated, but the calculations are hidden from view.
* They do mimic reality.

You could use simulations for developing a functional understanding, connecting input and output. As a consequence they're not so good at going deeper, since the attention is focussed on the surface appearances.

ThinkHeader{A computational model, to understand}

* The  rules of the imagined world  are exposed, explicit and modifiable.
* Models make explicit connections, which are coherent and self-consistent connections.
* Models gives deep insight into phenomena through making falsifiable predictions.

Such model are fully fledged tools to think with.

All three kinds of artefacts have an imagined author and reader, that is they are only fully intelligible once you investigate the practices of those who use them. How each community of such practices uses them will shift the artefact along the spectrum a little, but arguably only in the direction of somewhat less explicit representations. So a modeling tool could be used as a simulation, but a simulation does not allow access to changing the rules in such a way that you could use it as a modeling tool. And a simulation could be used as an animation, but an animation could not be used as a simulation.

### A note on  the QuoteThis{interactives} used in SPT
Interactives, as used in SPT,  are either simulations or animations: some are calculated and therefore simulate some facet of the physicist world, some are simply drawings, whether moving or not.

The interactives:

* explore some theoretical line of argument
* may or may not be intended to mimic the lived-in world (so they can support counter-factual reasoning)

Therefore you can use the interactives to explore how ideas in the imagined world hang together.

### Engagement in computational modeling
To engage children in computational modeling is to give them an enhanced chance to theorise—by giving them carefully shaped building blocks to assemble in a place where this assemblage is open to inspection and commentary by their peers and teachers. Giving children these opportunities in physics lessons is in many ways only equivalent to allowing children to draw in art lessons—they engage in some practice of physics in order to better appreciate the nature of physics (both what and how it represents—rather than just engaging in the equivalent of art appreciation classes).

The purpose of these assemblages is usually not too difficult to communicate in outline in the classroom, although the finer detail and the comparison of differing constructions might well be. Children assemble the blocks to produce a dynamic artefact that mimics some aspects of nature's behaviour. They invent a world that has some important similarities to the lived-in world around them. Their invented world will also have some differences—for a start it will necessarily be somewhat stripped down, paying attention to only a few of the aspects of the real world. Using computer based tools can make these models more explicit, inspect-able and so more public than in some other cases where "models" are used in science lessons.

Here I've just been clearing away the undergrowth on the way to exemplifying some cases where introducing computational modeling can be made to have significant paybacks.

### Computational physics, or physics through computation
Computational thinking brings you closer to the physics, so long as you concentrate on encoding the fundamental relationships and combing those in an algorithm, rather than just encoding the solutions.

So the trick is to use the computer to express a physically meaningful algorithm, not to use it as a glorified calculator. Its a synthetic and creative activity.

'The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs.' (Joseph Weizenbaum in Computer Power and Human Reason).

Having your thoughts reflected back is a real aid to seeing what you 'really' meant. As a rather famous aphorism has it: "How will I know what I think until I see what I write?". Imagining worlds, seeing how they behave, and comparing that behaviour with the lived-in world, is the process of computational modeling as described here.

### Programming art and skillful modeling
The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity, as is building tractable models

A part of the power of programming languages is that they take care of little details for us: the design of the language takes care of what counts as a detail, allowing a focus on the fruitful difficulty.

Introduction to a programming systems often stress different facets of the process. Here is an adapted ontology, that could be useful in physics classrooms where code is being used to express physics.

* You get started with primitives, which are the building blocks (perhaps as objects and functions) built into  provided by the environment.
* You combine the available building-blocks as required, making new assemblages.
* Naming these new assemblages gives you new building blocks—a process of abstraction—which also serves to hide the details that you no longer want to consider.
* Making selections, so choosing from the available building blocks as you make new assemblages.

This has a lot in common with broad-brush constructivist theories of learning . And nearly everyone in physics teaching seems to be somewhere on the constructivist spectrum. Some may even be constructionists: even more amenable to acticvities where things get built and thought about.

# Thoughts on developing pdl

### Preamble
We're developing an open expressive system, that's graphical in nature, to support teaching and learning of physics.

This system uses conventional representations, first developed for supporting physics teaching project (SPT) which may be controlled by computational code. This enables reasoning with the dynamic diagrams, to complement reasoning with algebra and reasoning with words.

An essential balance is for a specialised expressive medium with the degree of openness of the system.

### An analogy with writing
The alphabet Is perhaps the ultimate granular set of building blocks. You can arrange these in all kinds of ways, some of which will make sense to you, and some of the will be intelligible to others.  The extent to which these two possibilities overlap will be determined to a great extent by the successful adoption of shared conventions.

Words are the building blocks of spoken language, with all its shared conventions, and the intrinsic richness of multimodal communication. The words have affordances in the virtue of their use, but still have a great flexibility in deployment. You can express a great range of ideas, but you must engage in a lot of construction work, and so expressing yourself is effortful.

Complete sentences express propositions, and these are often read, rather than thought of as being a means of expressing  yourself. Nevertheless collecting and arranging sentences is a way of communicating more complex ideas,  assembling  larger chunks, perhaps provided by others, and even constructing arguments from such chunks.

* There's a significant question as to whether a specialised expression system should allow syntactic as well as semantic errors. The proliferation of graphical coding systems for young children with 'snap-together' components, that seek to eliminate syntactical errors.

### An analogy with drawing
Points, lines and arcs are the basis of drawing.

Shapes bundle useful collections of drawing primitives into convenient chunks. With these you can rapidly construct drawings, providing you are fluent in utilising these particular shapes.

* Tools to combine these basic shapes, such as grouping, union and exclusion greatly enhance utility of the essential shapes.

Clipart provides a form of extreme shortcut, to achieve certain well-defined kinds of drawings, but proscribe other kinds.

### All systems present affordances and constraints
Even at the most granular level, any  system of representation only permits some things to be expressed. So far, attempts to find a universal language, or a universal grammar, have not been successful.

The more familiar know-how and knowledge that is embedded in the system, the more it enables it to do for a given effort , but the more it constrains you.

If less know-how and knowledge is embedded in the system, then it is more effortful to achieve a certain expression. The trade off is access to  a greater the range of expressions.

### Computational systems
Computers are in essence representation machines.  Expressing yourself in the code gets as close to the flexibility inherent in the machine as is possible.

Code easily permits encapsulation, which in turn permits more complex expression in a more concise way. If the encapsulation is appropriate to the audience, then a more concise expression may well prove to be more intelligible. Encapsulation is an analogue of mental chunking which permits manipulation of more complex problems by hiding inappropriate detail, as well as enabling progression  in learning.  Thinking, and expressing yourself using representations at different levels of granularity, Is one way of addressing the onion shell nature of explanations in physics.

You can choose a level of granularity to serve your purpose—the expressive medium should make the choice of this level as frictionless as possible.

Any specialised representations should appear as extensions to common ways of expressing yourself, so you can easily make these changes in level. So you should not feel locked in to one specialised language, but rather be able to mix and match levels  to say what you would like to say, making use of the affordances of the more complex structured language where you'd like to, but also being able to switch to more granular language where this more complex language presents inappropriate resistances.

### Consequences
The upshot is that any open system should be built within, and perhaps using, a readily available language. The use of that language should not be restricted unless absolutely necessary to implement the more specialised, higher order functions of the particular system. As with the analogies with language or drawing, you can think of this at three levels:

The lowest level is the base language(for the purposes of thinking about teaching and learning physics this will be a scripting language): python, JavaScript, processingjs, or similar.

* There is an active line of research that suggests children may be well served by inventing their own representations, and evolving these as a way of refining their ideas. At the moment this seems restricted to pencil and paper expressions of those representations. Nevertheless, one can see that a system such this one could provide a more public, more provisional, and more reactive medium. All three of these enhancements could plausibly contribute to a more flexible and fruitful construction of representations, that better support learning.

The next level it to give access to the graphical representations, so reducing the cognitive demand in expressing yourself, by removing the need to translate the code primitives of the language of lines, arcs and points into conventional representations. Encapsulation is equivalent to reifying the representation: making the representation themselves objects to think with that are public, dynamic and responsive to the code.

* This is true provided that the conventional representations are familiar, and at least partially understood.
	* Tools to combine the representations greatly extend the expressive power in the same way that tools to combine simple shapes allow the construction of more sophisticated complex drawings.

	  Grammar had a similar coherent effect in shaping the way in which words may be combined to express propositions.

The final level is the functional equivalent of clip art or of complete sentences. Here expressing certain things, and especially particular relationships is almost effortless, but you must pay for that lack of effort because only a certain range of representations, and a range of connections between representations have been made available. It is just like writing a story by rearranging sentences provided by others—you cannot create your own sentences: it is just like drawing a picture by assembling clipart—there are very limited range of things that can be depicted.

### Accumulations and constraints—graphically
A triangle could usefully suggest change over time, and therefore a visual reminder that the relationship changes with time.
A—▲—B
(coded as B+=A)
This accumulate symbol is  unicode:  ▲, Unicode: U+25B2

A square could represent constraint, suggesting geometrical reasoning to follow.
To represent a constraint?
A—◼—B
(coded as A=B & B=A, so equality, not assignment)
This constrain symbol is unicode: ◼  , Unicode: U+25FC.

It's possibly to think of going further, exploring the use of the triple bar character, ≡, identical to (HTML ≡ · ≡  Unicode  U+2261) to emphasise  the semiotic separation of assignment and identity, but this might be a step too far in particularity, removing the expressions one step further from conventional coding.)

One reason for using unicode is to think that it might assist in a literate form of coding, where we can use a richer set of symbols than the alphanumeric, whilst requiring nothing but a text editor to create the model.

### Accumulations and constrains— in words
There are several metaphors in use for describing dynamical processes:

* accumulate
* rate
* grow

As an example:
What sets how the velocity changes? The acceleration does.

In thinking about  force and motion you might try out these phrases for their evocative value, fruitfulness and intelligibility:

* position is accumulated by velocity
* you accumulate velocity to get position
* the velocity tells the position how to grow
* the change in the position is set by the velocity
* position = accumulation of velocity

There are rather fewer phrases for atemporal relationship:

* constrain
* follow
* values

More examples, to try out for fruitfulness.
* Acceleration follows force
* force constrains acceleration

Then there is the need to combine inputs, as little interesting can be said in static systems without it.  More can usefully be said in dynamical systems, as change is intrinsic, and rates of change are central. In elementary physics it is universally with respect to time, so Newton's ideas of fluents and fluxions may prove fruitful.

### Growing and shrinking
But there is still a decision to be made here: should all contributions  be considered positive, requiring a pair of opposites:

A accumulates B: A diminished B
A—▲—B:  A —▼—B

A more elegant solution is that accumulations can be negative only as a consequence of the accumulator being negative. So the fluent will increase in value if the fluxion is positive, but decrease in value if the fluxion is negative. This has the consequence that fluxions, such as acceleration, velocity, power need to be allowed to have negative values as well as positive: that's fine for the former pair, which can usefully be thought of as vectors right from the time they are first met, but introduces an issue with power, which is normally considered a scalar. Scalars can, of course, be positive as well as negative, but elementary treatment of vectors usually reduces them to one dimension, so simplifying them to a signed quantity. This elegant solution to accumulations would therefore imply a rethink of the teaching of acceleration and other vector quantities. But that may be preferable to meeting 'decelleration'.

### Getting closer to code
constraints:
a is set by b/c, as a skin on a=b/c
accumulations:
a is incremented by b, as a skin of a+=b

This is the reverse of VnR, which was more active and allowed the flow of ideas across the page. That may or may not gain anything. But maybe such a sequence is more like code, so better.

### Contributions
Output variables  being affected by more than one input variable is common in dynamical modeling systems, as its rare that one quantity is determined solely by one other.

VnR automatically parsed this as:

output

* input1 contributes to the rate at which more stuff changes (and in the opposite sense)

* input2 contributes to the value of more stuff

the 2 inputs are added

That feels mechanically parsed, but I'm not sure that we have an elegant language for describing this.

### Diagrams, geometry, and constraints
There are a few successful examples of quantitative reasoning with diagrams, for example the AVOW diagrams in reasoning about resistive circuits. However these seem to be rather special cases, and there is no general pattern here —apart from reasoning with graphs. The graph is not generally treated explicitly as a geometrical diagram, with geometrical reasoning applied, at least in teaching physics. However I think that the success of the AVOW approach suggests that dealing with constraints relationships by geometry might be fruitful.

Constraints could be re-presented as geometrical relations. But this immediately raises questions.
- With what ease can you go between theses different representations?
- Is there a core of geometrical reasoning competence which can be leveraged?
- If there are more than three terms on the equation, what happens to the geometrical representation?
- If it is necessarily the case that number of dimensions of figure = (number of variables-1) to allow for use of gradient and area / volume, then there could be some visualisation difficulties. (Also, added complexity: you'd need to think which gradient— this interpretation could hinder, not help.)

Two hard patterns of thinking are proportion and compensation—in two dimensional space these can be re-imagined as gradients and areas. Compensation is more general. In that proportion is necessarily binary, whereas compensation can be multi-variate. So is compensation a generalised version of proportion.

Newton thought geometrically— this appears to be a source of inspiration, until you try and read the Principia.

### More divergent thoughts
You can have result of accumulations, then move outside of time, and the pattern of connections is a constraint relationship again.

Are all linear constraint relationships QuoteThis{really} compensated quantities? Is that a helpful unification? And if so, for children?

It becomes a didactical question as to how to present relationships . As classical mechanics is about dynamic evolution it's best to exploit this when you can. Physics is all about what happens next: from this state, do I know enough rules to figure out the next state?

But the equations of one state are not like this: they are constraint equations. All you can do is to explore (im)possibilities. It's here that you need to intervene whilst the model is running to explore possibilities.

How many of rate relationships in elementary physics are simply tautologies?

Finding the scope of the applicability of relationships is often all important, and distinguishes mathematical tautology from physical tautology.

This is all about the scope of applicability.A good example is relationship between density mass and volume—this only applies provided the gravitational field is not so large that the density varies.More examples will be needed to make the point in general and convincingly.

Mathematics and physics both share a common pattern of reasoning, from which mutual interactions arise. It is not the case for one rules the other.

Maybe one facet of a modeling tool is simply to allow you to explore the consequence if combining known relationships, so using large building blocks?

About doing simple things elegantly, with pedagogic transparency.

Can you build explorable systems so you can drill down:

* in a graphical environment?
* in a textual environment?

### A few uses of models appearing in physics classrooms

* Energy constraints: represent what is and what is not possible
* accumulations (pattern important, but often not separated out from the particular quantities)
* constraints (must get some in beyond three-term identities, and separate out the tautological from the empirical—which may turn on pedagogical decisions)
* combining sets of constraining  relationships: networks of equations
* interactively exploring the behaviour of  a single relationship, e.g. a compensation

### More work needed
Combining accumulations with constraints  is hard to do elegantly: do you want to intervene in the model or not?
