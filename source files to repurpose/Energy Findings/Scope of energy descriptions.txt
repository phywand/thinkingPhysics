Scope of energy descriptions
The idea of energy is a tool to think with–suitable for some tasks but not for others. 
You could knock a nail in with an adjustable spanner, or maybe even tighten a screw.  But for some tasks it is particularly well-suited – by design. The idea of energy has evolved in exactly this way–whereas it is possible to try and describe every process with energy, it is not fruitful to do so.
To teach wisely is to choose examples which illustrate where it is plausible, intelligible and fruitful to do so: children can learn to reason with the idea of energy in ways that do not distort its usage in the scientific community.
The principles, framework and exemplars are our suggestions to guide these necessary judgements.
