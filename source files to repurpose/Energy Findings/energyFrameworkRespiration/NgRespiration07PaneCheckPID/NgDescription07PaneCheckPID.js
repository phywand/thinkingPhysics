var insightCommentary ="Energy is shifted from the chemical store associated with glucose and oxygen to the gravitational store and thermal store by the process of respiration. Respiration is largely equivalent to a slow combustion reaction, taking place inside a living cell. Respiration causes heating and the formation of a chemical called ATP, which enables energy to reach other parts of the cell, as a result of chemical reactions. Aerobic respiration takes place in the mitochondria of a cell and requires sufficient oxygen and glucose. The whole process can be simplified with the chemical equation: glucose + oxygen â†’ carbon-dioxide + water (+ energy)Athletic training strengthens the heart muscle and the muscles that inflate the lungs, to enable a quicker uptake of oxygen from the air and faster transport of glucose and oxygen in the blood.";
