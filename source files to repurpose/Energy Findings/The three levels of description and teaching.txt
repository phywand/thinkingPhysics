The steps levels of description and teaching
The structure of the energy descriptions which is part of a passage of teaching consists of three levels:

Level 1 is all about the lived-in world and consists of a description of changes of every day objects using everyday terms.

Level 2 is split into two complementary halves.

The first half is an operationalisation of measures by a process of noticing and recording elements of the lived-in world, bring them into focus so that they can be a part of a physical description. The second half is complimentary to this and provides imagined mechanisms which can be a mental model to enable you to get a grip on what is happening during a process( and so provide an explanatory mechanism).

Level 3 is the energy level: it depends on the operationalised measures established in the second level, but does not depend on (a grasp of) – and in fact complements – the physical mechanisms described in the second level.


Any proposed passage of teaching which invokes the idea of energy should develop this idea through the levels: that is to say developing an energy description – using the idea of energy – is about working through the levels with your class, rather than trying to jump straight to an account in terms of energy. This structure is intended to reduce difficulties by providing a framework in which talk about energy is much more likely to consist of sensible talk, and not a word game. It is highly recommended that non-verbal resources are used to complement the words, as words by themselves are somewhat slippery, and not well suited to introducing children to precise yet abstract ideas.
