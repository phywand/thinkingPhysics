A working group

The teaching of energy has been contested over several decades. This group was drawn from across the subject specialisms in the sciences and met over 2018-2019. The findings provide suggestions for representing the idea of energy accessibly, courteously and accurately.

After reflecting on the findings the group thought that one of the worst ways of realising these suggestions was to have a topic in the scheme of work labelled "energy", or anything similar. The whole point of an energy description is that it is a very general and wide-ranging tool for thinking with, capable of yielding insights in many topic areas.
