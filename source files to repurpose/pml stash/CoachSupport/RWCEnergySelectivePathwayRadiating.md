WebTitle{Heating by radiation pathway does not always seem like a good fit}

The pathway is called heating by radiation to denote interaction with a simple material – a perfect black body. The power in the pathway is the sum over the frequencies present in the beam of GroupBlock{n SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{h} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{f}}, where n is the number of JustUnit{photons  second -1}. That gives, as expected, a power in watts, retaining the essential link between qualitative descriptions and calculated quantities as the touchstone for not generating less-than-helpful energy descriptions.

For many interactions with matter, the power in the pathway can be correctly calculated like this, but as you’re not interested in heating (photosynthesis, photovoltaic cells) the pathway seems a misnomer, and could cause misdirection: there is a mismatch whereever selective absorption plays a role. Instead of GroupBlock{n SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{h} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{f}}, for all QuantitySymbol{f}, you restrict the sum over frequencies to only a few frequencies. That is, you’re selective, having a restricted domain in mind fro the description. So although it remains thermodynamically correct to retain the QuoteThis{heating by radiation} pathway, given the purposes of a description preclude consideration of heating (by excluding photons of certain frequencies), the act of selection suggests QuoteThis{selective radiating}. 

This is to allow for the messy interaction of radiation with matter, rather than just considering the pathway. Such interactions are typically well described by quantum mechanics, where the Newtonian idea of force has evaporated, so I've chosen not to associate the pathway with working: I think the connection with radiating is enough to retain its familial place, as I think in practice it's only for cases of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter, or photons with matter, 

ThinkHeader{Proposal}

Allow QuoteThis{selective radiating} as a special case of QuoteThis{heating by radiating} for cases where the description results in quantum mechanical effects not best associated with heating, eg photo-chemistry, photo-voltaic cells, photosynthesis.
