WebTitle{Avoiding a return to the past}

There was a time, let us suppose it was around the time of the Science National Strategies, when it was common to describe a process, or perhaps even a start and end state and demand an energy account for that case. Often these demands required considerable ingenuity in order to provide such an account, but in many cases the ingenuity was entirely wasted. Fascinating as a scholastic exercise, reminiscent of the time when it was all the rage to debate the number of angels that might live on a pin-head, but not fruitful in supporting teachers and learners of the sciences. Put more bluntly, it was a distraction from productive work on how to engage children in the sciences.

Now there is a danger of those times returning, seemingly by an algorithmic approach to generating energy accounts: caricatured as 'start and end point analysis'. It seems that there is a habit of thinking emerging that suggests specifying a start and end point is all you need to ensure that a valid account will be generated.

Generating fruitful descriptions of nature is a lot more subtle than that, even in the realm of 'normal science' (as defined by Kuhn).

A recent example–with apologies for a straight lift from an email exchange:

"Start point: a star doing its stellar thing

End point: after it’s gone nova, but before all the photons emitted have hit anything"

I look at this for a long time and wonder what insights I hope to gain from generating such a description. And no, since you ask, no more context is given. When faced with questions like this, I think we need to step back and ask what the purpose of developing the description is, because physics itself is purposive – it is a human activity to satisfy human curiosity about our world.

So where and how to start. Well, I'd suggest in the 'lived-in' world of the children.

1. From there, isolate a process by drawing attention to certain features of the world. [Identify the Process]
2. If you can envisage that an energy description might be fruitful – because it will suggest what is not possible – then bound the process in space and time to define two snapshots by developing a careful physical description.[Bound the Process]
3. Pay attention to this physical description to identify changes in stores of energy: a qualitative description. Once you have identified the stores, then calculate of estimate the changes in the stores. (Trying to jump straight to the  (semi-)quantitative bar charts (best deployed showing energy changes) often causes confusion, perhaps because the teachers are doing several steps in thinking supported by a single depiction.)[Qualitative then Quantitative]
4. Now return to the original process and see what insights your hard work has yielded. It may be that there is not one, but you may have chosen wisely. [Insight Gained]

So there are four necessary steps to the art of generating an energy description:

1. Identify the process
2. Bound the process, generating to snapshots
3. Qualitative then quantitative energy accounts, switching context
4. Check for insight gained

You may choose to elide any one of these, but that would be unwise. It is a case where keeping some moves hidden results in the process making less sense.
