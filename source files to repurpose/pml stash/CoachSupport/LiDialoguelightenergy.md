WebTitle{ Refactoring your understanding is hard}

TeacherOne{Surely light is an energy. I mean, the microwave background's just been there for ever.}

TeacherTwo{I don't think the whole universe is a very good place to start thinking about energy. After all, there are some high-powered cosmologists who think that energy is not conserved for the universe as a whole. Something about time invariance and general relativity, I seem to remember.}

TeacherOne{But anyway, light is energy.}

TeacherThree{Maybe it's best to think of a few situations, and see how useful that assertion is. After all, the whole development of the conservation of energy idea came from practical men, with practical concerns.}

TeacherOne{What do you suggest?}

TeacherThree{Here's one for a gloomy day in the prep room. Remember yourself in the garden, warming your face in the summer sun&hellip;}

TeacherOne{Exactly: light is transformed to heat.}

TeacherTwo{But last week you said that energy was all about doing calculations. What are the calculations you'd do here?}

TeacherOne{Umm&hellip;}

 TeacherThree{The lighting, or radiating, is best modelled as a flow, I think. That is, a radiant power, in watts.}

 TeacherTwo{So the increased energy in the thermal store depends on the power and the time.}

 TeacherOne{But light is an energy, just like kinetic.}

 TeacherThree{I'm not so sure. For a bike braking, you can certainly calculate the energy in the kinetic store before, and after the braking, and figure out the maximum temperature rise in the brakes. I can't see a useful similar calculation for a depleted QuoteThis{light store}.}

 TeacherTwo{Yes, energy in gravity stores just sits about, ready to be depleted. I don't see how you can apply exactly the same idea to light. It's not a QuoteThis{sitting-about} kind of thing. Any more than electric current is.}

TeacherThree{That's just the basis for having two kinds of things: those naturally calculated in watts (finding the power in pathways) and those naturally calculated in joules(finding energy shifted to or from stores). One is about accumulations, the other about flows.}
