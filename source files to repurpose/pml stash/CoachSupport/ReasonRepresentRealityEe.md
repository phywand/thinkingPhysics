StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: Electrical loops}

Reasoning is done with loops as the systemic nature of circuits ensures that what's in a complete loop results in constraints amongst the electrical measures of quantities in a circuit. In any loop:

FractionCBA{current}{potential difference}{resistance}

Holding one constant and varying another results in the third being constrained to vary also – that's what the equals sign means.

In practice you always choose the potential difference and the resistance in assembling the loop.

Such variations in current and pd also set the power dissipated in each element and the power supplied by the source.

Loops with series and parallel follow the same pattern of the current being set by the choices made in seting up the circuit.

For parallel circuits deal with each loop separately, then combine the loops. The current in any wire is the sum of the currents in each loop of which that wire is a part.

StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: Pathways and devices}

Devices switch power between four possible pathways, which are qualitatiev descriptions for potential calculations of power in each pathway.

Which leads naturally to thinking about efficiency, and devices which better switch the power to the target pathway(where the designer would like it).

There is a particular focus on electromagnetic devices, where filed lines shortening and straightening are the key to predicting where there will be electromagnetic forces.

An example of straightening:

An example of shortening:

This is a very physical mode of thinking, following Faraday.

StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: Quantification}


Energy is quantitative: now you can do some calculations, such as:

KineticCalc{change of energy in kinetic store}

Whilst respecting the connection between power and energy:

energy shifted  = power MultipliedBy Delta time

StepHeader{So power is what is happening: energy is what has happened}

InsertGraphic{RRREePowerAccumulatesPID}{800}{500}

As power is switched to different pathways, and energy accumulates in different stores it's possible to calculate efficiencies as well:


EfficiencyCalc{WordSub{energy}{out}}{WordSub{energy}{in}}

EfficiencyCalc{WordSub{power}{out}}{WordSub{power}{in}}
