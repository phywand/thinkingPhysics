WebTitle{ Who reaches the bottom of a run first?}

TeacherOne{I lent my phone to my son, to see how quickly he could get down the slope.}

TeacherTwo{That sounds risky.}

TeacherOne{The app was good, you can see the profile and everything. He got to 90.}

TeacherTwo{Ninety? Oh, kilometres an hour. Still, that's pretty quick.}

TeacherOne{He always beats me down}

TeacherTwo{Surely he's lighter, so he cannot get down first. You're heavier.}

TeacherOne{But he always beats me down, and he's only 9.}

TeacherTwo{You are heavier so surely you've got more momentum, so you'll get to the bottom first.}
