WebTitle{ How careful to be about mass?}

TeacherOne{I know you've been a bit concerned about the use of QuoteThis{charges}, recently. So why haven't you made such a fuss about QuoteThis{masses}?}

TeacherTwo{well, for one thing, I can handle masses, and it seems a bit pedantic not to refer to the cylindrical objects in the lab as QuoteThis{100 gram masses}. I cannot handle and point to charges, so it's worth being a bit more careful with the words, to compensate for this lack of tactile contribution to the idea of charge.}

TeacherOne{Yes. I don't see myself referring to those QuoteThis{objects of mass 100 gram} any time soon. But is there something, do you think?}

TeacherThree{Energy, charge and mass are amongst the hardest ideas, so we ought to be careful. Two are properties of particles, the other of systems, but that's not going to get us far.}

TeacherOne{Surely saying QuoteThis{masses} is not unhelpful, as the name of the objects we have in the lab, or even when discussing enacting the leaning tower of Pisa experiment?}

TeacherTwo{I'd go with that.  But I'd still choose not to refer to masses, when it's not things I'm handling, or can point to.}

TeacherThree{Yes, I think that there is value in the phrase: QuoteThis{the mass of }. I think we'd gain if we were explicit and talked of things or objects or even particles (in the Newtonian sense), and then identified their properties. After all, at some stage we'll have to prepare our pupils to meet the QuoteThis{point mass} and the QuoteThis{point charge}. We cannot shelter them for ever.}
