WebTitle{ Teaching ideas â€“ beyond words}

TeacherOne{Have you heard? The english department say the government insist on us using the words QuoteThis{mass} and QuoteThis{weight} interchangeably.}

TeacherTwo{So much for respect between the QuoteThis{two cultures}. Perhaps we should point out that both commas and periods are used as decimal separators, so they should stop being so persnickety about punctuation.}

TeacherOne{I'm not sure that's going to help us here. But in any case, the curriculum statements oblige us to teach the difference, so it's not clear what status the guidance can have.}

TeacherTwo{Apart from demonstrating a lack of joined up thinking.}

TeacherOne{Not in a constructive mood today, are we?}

TeacherTwo{So what can we do to counter this nonsense?}

TeacherThree{Well, words alone have never served us well, so perhaps we ought to think of what we can show and do, as well as what we can tell.}

TeacherTwo{Well, I always tell them about the 400 g of ham, and how it's the same amount of stuff on butchers in different planets, whatever the local gravity.}

TeacherThree{But surely if we wanted to be pedantic in the butchers, and zero in on quantity of matter, we'd be asking for a number of moles, as that's the SI unit for quantity of substance.}

TeacherTwo{I know I'm not interested in how difficult the ham is to accelerate, but asking for moles in the butcher just is a step too far.}

TeacherOne{So even for you there are compromises?}

TeacherThree{So back to the question, what actions and representations will we choose to engage the children with, so that we can offer a more fruitful way of understanding the difference? I think we've just seen that words alone will not carry us}

TeacherTwo{D'you think we should be focussing on gravitational mass, or inertial mass?}
