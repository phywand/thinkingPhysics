WebTitle{ Coaching - 3 elements?}

It may be helpful to think of coaching as drawing on three kinds of thinking and doing, on three kinds of QuoteThis{know-how}.

ThinkHeader{Probe}

Find out what's known and what is unknown—QuoteThis{probe-how}.
Use non-threatening, but often challenging and always engaging, stimuli to explore participants understanding.

PupilSpeak{Target Outcome}{I've never really thought about it (like that/ at all/ and did not realise that…)}

ThinkHeader{Show}

Enact, exemplify and so enliven a piece of teaching—QuoteThis{show-how}.

Act out a real teaching episode, wrapping it in a meta-level discussion that contextualises and enriches, but never replaces, the real action.

PupilSpeak{Target Outcome}{I can see how you develop the idea and that the approach might work for me.}

ThinkHeader{Tell}

Advise: share moderated experience and insight from research and implementations—QuoteThis{tell-how}.

PupilSpeak{Target Outcome}{I did not know about that, and can see how it connects to what I might try in my classroom}

The balance will vary to suit the occasion, but coaching necessarily involves an interplay across all three elements.
