StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: group of mini-magnets}

The main tool for reasoning is the group of mini-magnets, sometimes
 known as a group of domains.

StepHeader{What the group of mini-magnets is made of: constituents}

- many identical small magnets of variable orientation

StepHeader{What the group of mini-magnets can do: capabilities}

- generate a magnetic field
- act like a coil of current carrying wire

StepHeader{What the group of mini-magnets can have done to it: changes}

- increase the number of mini-magnets
- decrease the number of mini-magnets
- change the alignment of the mini-magnets

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the mini-magnets}

- how to magnetise and demagnetise
- where the poles of a magnet will be
- the strength of a magnetic field

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope  for the mini-magnets}

- permanent magnets
- fields of permanent magnets

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- no common patterns

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- Semi-quantitative reasoning
- reductionism

StepHeader{Future developments for the mini-magnets}
