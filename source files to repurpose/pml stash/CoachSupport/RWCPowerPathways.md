WebTitle{Reasoning about pathways – reasoning with pathways}

Power is always found in pathways. Why so? Because that's all pathways are: a qualitative , and perhaps semi-quantitative description that's a placeholder for the calculations that will follow later on in the study of energy flows.


StepHeader{Deciding on a moderate number of building blocks}

Four pathways seems plenty to reason with, enabling faithful descriptions of useful calculations that might really be done. You could argue for more pathways, or fewer pathways, but this might lead to descriptions that are too fine-grained, or too coarse-grained to be recognisable once the calculations start. It's a matter of judgement as to what's needed to support fruitful reasoning with these representations – that is children's reasoning.


StepHeader{All about tenses}

Calculating how much power is in a pathway can only be done for a process that is happening.  That pathway might be filling or emptying a store, or there may be a device switching the power to one or more other pathways. But it's happening: time is passing.

You can set off along the right lines by using appropriate tenses:
- What's happening
- Stores are filling
- Stores are filling

StepHeader{Using pathways}

Pathways fill or empty stores: that is, energy accumulates in a store (and another store is depleted, as a result of power in a pathway. This is a description that enables smooth movement  from the qualitative to the quantitative.

This is all a part of the idea that power in a pathway accumulates energy in a store. There is much more in:

FrameNugget{Ee04PN}

A device can switch a pathway.

Again, this forms a stepping-stone to more quantitative  descriptions, such as calculations of efficiency. Much more in:

FrameNugget{Ee04PNnugget02}

StepHeader{Decisions which have been difficult for some}

Thinking about interaction with photons seems to encourage a movement to resurrect the QuoteThis{light store}, even amongst those who think of lighting as a pathway( which is clearly a process, so most naturally reasoned about using power).  Photons are quanta of interaction: at low enough intensities it's fruitful to represent the lighting arriving in chunks, not as a continuous  activity. Then the power is the activity multiplied by the energy of each interaction:

ProductABC{QuantitySymbol{P}}{QuantitySymbol{A}}{QuantitySymbol{h}QuantitySymbol{f}}

I don't see that this commits you to suggesting that the photons poodles around in space as a little store: in fact quantum physics has rather a lot to say about asserting the continued existence of entities when they are not interacting.

Mechanical waves, such as density waves(sound) or water waves. These are treated very mechanically, for example in the way that we explain hearing. There is identifiable pushing and pulling on macroscopic objects, such as eardrums, loudspeaker cones and  the moving parts of devices to switch the power of sea waves to electrical working. This being so, it seems most fruitful treat these as mechanical working, later to be calculated by GroupThis{force MultipliedBy velocity}. That provides a stepping-stone (the qualitative descriptions) between the physical descriptions of such vibrations and the calculations to come.

Electromagnetic waves. Where the process is being described by charged particles that are being pushed to and fro, that seems to lead to thinking about  GroupThis{force MultipliedBy velocity}, so pushing and pulling, where force is given by GroupThis{electric field strength MultipliedBy charge}. This is so similar to mechanical working that it seems to missing emphasising a connection not to use the electrical working pathway. That has further advantages in thinking about alternating current(so neatly modeled with the rope loop), as also being electrical working. Where the process is not modeled by shoving individual charged particles about, then its better to use heating by radiation as the pathway to emphasise the coming links with thermodynamic thinking. I don't think that its fruitful to try for a rule of thumb that says  QuoteThis{Oh, it's an electromagnetic wave, so no more thinking needed, must be heating by radiation}. That approach misses out on the pursuit of linking the  phenomenon to a fruitful description: also know as physics.

Thinking about Chemical changes, perhaps particularly bio-chemical changes  has led some to suggest a QuoteThis{chemical pathway}. I think we need to be really careful here: there is a danger in inventing an answer (or feeling the need to  invent such an answer) to every question that can be posed in words. We'd do well to remember the function of a pathway, which is to provide a qualitative stepping-stone description for a calculation  to come. I'm not convinced that biochemists and chemists reason with  power and accumulate that over time to find the energy in a store, or figure out how much power is switched from one pathway another. There is certainly no evidence of it in A level biology texts: when I last looked they had three kinds of valuations in.  Chemists do rather more calculating, but with energy, not power, I think. It's possible that power is calculated, but as an average rate of change of energy.

StepHeader{Keeping the razor to hand}

In summary, I think there is a preliminary question to be asked before inventing a new pathway: does the proposed pathway provide a qualitative description for a calculation that children will do in the foreseeable near future?  I suppose a corollary of that is that the pathways idea is not fundamentally about listing every mechanism, but is rather about providing a qualitative stepping-stone, to do a first-pass description of calculation involving (instantaneous) power. Only if there are really such calculations that we'd like children to reason about semi-qualitatively is it worth inventing a new pathway, to add to their kit-set. I think that's because we're trying to represent the sciences as they are, not invent an alternative account (which may well suffer from completist tendencies). If the justification for the pathway is a calculation that does not appear until degree level, or beyond, than I think that's another reason for being parsimonious. These entities are supposed to be tools for children to reason with, not a rational reconstruction of every specialism in the sciences.

StepHeader{Making your life in teaching easier}

Identifiable pushing and pulling could perhaps usefully be restricted to working: either mechanical or electrical.

Rather more thermodynamic processes, where the mechanism is more a matter of statistical averages, rather than mechanistic  mechanical interactions, you might restrict to heating, so heating by particles and heating by radiation.

StepHeader{Making your life in teaching harder}

Don't try and invent qualitative descriptions for calculations that no-one does. If the calculations are not done, there is probably a reason, and that should be warning that you're in danger of inventing a description  that is not a courteous translation of science that is really done. Then, I suspect, you are not longer teaching the sciences, but some version of another subject that we might label QuoteThis{school science}.
