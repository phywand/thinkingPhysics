StepHeader{Misinterpreting a relationship}

That there is a relationship:

ProductABC{QuantitySymbol{E}}{QuantitySymbol{h}}{QuantitySymbol{f}}

seems to be causing difficulty with the idea of light as a pathway, leading people to suggest that light might have to be thought of as a store. There is already a dialogue, to open up teachers' thinking , further extended with a study guide.

StepHeader{Quanta emptying a store}

The idea of emptying stores one chunk at time is not hard.

The case for having in mind pathways rather than stores when teaching the  light and sound topics is made in a Physics Education article from 2008 (January, pp. 62-67). The medium is connecting the source and detector: so long as you are seeing or hearing. These are processes, so naturally about power, not energy.

The whole of SPT rests on, amongst other considerations, a careful distinction between energy and power, and this is maintained in the SPT episode on introducing  photons:

InsertLinkPN{A narrative about photons}{Ra02PN.html}.

Here photons are introduced as a quantum of interaction – you can only state anything sensible about a photon when it is emitted or absorbed.  There is a good deal of entirely necessary uncertainty about what happens between these two events, neatly captured in the many-paths formulation of quantum physics. So the photon is either filling or emptying a store. At quantum scales this filling is granular: stores are filled or emptied in chunks.

That's quantum physics.

If you are modeling energy as an orange fluid, that's where the measuring spoons come in (whole spoonfuls only, and spoons of different colours to represent different frequencies).

StepHeader{The source of the difficulty?}

The difficulty only seems to come if you insist on the photon continuing to 'exist', in-between emission and absorption.  I suppose you could insist on such a thing, but that would be to  head off along the 'wrong tracks', misrepresenting the quantum world as being filled with particles—including photons—that have a continuous  existence. So far as we know, non-locality rules that idea out.

StepHeader{Avoiding difficulty}

The SPT: Radiations and radiating topic takes the ideas in the SPT: Light topic and the SPT: Energy topic and shows how a feasible path to thinking about the quantum world can be realistically introduced in classrooms, including using quantum reasoning to unify the phenomena of refraction, reflecting, interference and diffraction.
