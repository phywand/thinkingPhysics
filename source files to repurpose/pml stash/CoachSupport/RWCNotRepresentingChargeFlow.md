WebTitle{Representing flow in electrical loops}

The idea that something flows in electric circuits is important: but what's described as flowing depends on the composition of a particular element of the loop: in nerve cells it'll be metal ions; in  electrolytic cells compound ions of both negative and positive charge; in semi-conductors absences of electrons or holes; in metallic wires electrons. At the macroscopic level all of these are flowing charge, and in pre-16 teaching the predictive reasoning about electrical circuits is effectively done with the ideas of current, potential difference, power and resistance. All of these are macroscopic representations: so there would have to be good reason to descend to the complexities of the microscopic in developing accounts of electrical loops. I think that there are many good reasons not to try describe the particles moving as a basis for developing an understanding electrical circuits.

As ever, a key criterion for developing a piece of scientific knowledge with children is the consideration of how the idea can be used to make their reasoning more effective: Physics is something done, so lived inside; not something known about from a distance.

StepHeader{What flows, and consequences}

Many different particles that are charged can have bulk movements that will be recorded as an electrical current. A powerful description focuses on what is common across all such movements: that there is something moving around the loop, and that this results in a measurable current. To dig more deeply than that is to engage in a level of detail with which children may not be able to reason, and where too much is hard to work into a good teaching sequence. You could just tell children: QuoteThis{in metallic wires the particles that are moving are electrons and these are negatively charged}. But it is hard to see how you could support engagement with this statement, either by demonstrating some physical phenomenon in the lab, or by asking children to reason with these representations .

There has also been a tendency to develop an understanding of electric circuits as a QuoteThis{donation model} whereby QuoteThis{charges} collect  energy (sweets, coal sacs, loaves of bread etc) at the battery and distribute it according to some arbitrary rules at different elements of the circuit.

But donation models do lead children  off down the wrong tracks about energy.

I'd suggest that you also avoid the tendency to talk about the interaction of the QuoteThis{charges} with the concentrations of charge on the battery terminals—this is again a level of detail too far: too for for the children to reason with confidently and competently. Heading off down this wrong track is perhaps encouraged by a focus on the charged particles in the circuit: there is a temptation to make connections with the idea of forces replacing interactions: but what happens in circuits is not simple.

Finally, a focus on QuoteThis{charges} is a focus on a property of particles: just as you cannot have disembodied QuoteThis{mass} so you cannot have disembodied QuoteThis{charge}. A particle will have a mass, and it may have a charge. (But the particle cannot have a force, or an energy).

Maybe its best just to say:

TeacherSpeak{In all electrical loops something flows around: in different loops many different particles can be moving. But in every loop the strange something that flows we'll call QuotationThis{charge}.}


StepHeader{Visual distortions in representations}

There remains a desire to just draw it: to show what is really happening inside wires. Where drawings encourage precision and the representation encourages and can be used for reasoning, I am all in favour. However, in this case the drawing is subject to a number of constraints, all of which have a tendency to lead children (and perhaps their teachers) off down a wrong track. A pressing temptation is to represent what is happening in metallic wires, as these are components in most commonly studied circuits, so I'll focus on such diagrams, whether animated or not.

StepHeader{Scale and placement}

Starting with a snapshot, there are two immediate issues: scale and randomness.  Here the larger gradient filled circles are assumed to be ions, and the smaller blobs electrons.

InsertGraphic{PoVWireToChargeCarriersIPSC}

Such a diagram should trigger a host of questions, all of which distract from developing the macroscopic understanding of electrical circuits.

TeacherSpeak{Surely, as we commonly teach, QuotationThis{atoms are mostly empty space}, why are the grey blobs so apparent solid, and so impenetrable to electrons?}

TeacherSpeak{And are the electrons really only that much smaller than the ions?}

TeacherSpeak{What does the space around the grey blobs represent—I thought atoms filled the wire?}

TeacherSpeak{Are the electrons supposed to be randomly placed: I thought they were bound to ions?}

Each of these could be answered, but it's not clear that the answers will develop the core ideas in electrical circuits: and the essential idealisations and simplifications present subtleties of argument that complicate and distract, so representing superfluous  effort. Maybe nice to do, but only if we have spare time after doing a good job on getting children representing and reasoning about circuits.

(A case could be made for using such a diagram in passing, but perhaps not to then animate it, and to suggest that the animation is an essential component in the reasoning about electrical circuits.)

StepHeader{Charge and interactions}

Drawing individual ions and electrons next to each other begs the question about the interaction between these charged particles: and the answer is not simple, or fruitful. There are many, many interactions to consider for each electron, probably only soluble by introducing the idea of an electrical field and removing the ions: which does raise the question of why ions are represented in the first place. Again, to get to a representation with which you can reason (electrons and electric fields) requires many steps of abstraction, simplification and idealisation which do not contribute to the development of the core ideas of electrical loops. And just maybe you'll be drawn into the mysteries of metallic bonding to explain just why the ions hang together in a wire. This is a second facet of the representation which suggests that it is not likely to be fruitful.

StepHeader{Movements of two kinds}

Moving on to animations:  the ions are often drawn as stationary, but this is only the case at absolute zero: that unobtainable temperature. So that's one distortion. More seriously the electrons have two kinds of movements: one of high velocity and one of low velocity. It's the low velocity, less visually obvious velocity, that is important to the bulk flow of charges in an electrical wire: the drift velocity. There is so much difference in the values of the velocity that the high thermal velocity is usually not even hinted at on the animations showing electrons in wires. For reference, the velocities in a laboratory wire are approximately (they will vary depending on the current and the temperature):

Drift velocity: ValueUnit{0.000 1}{metre second -1}


Thermal velocity: ValueUnit{1 000 000}{metre second -1}

So if (and it is a big if) you want to represent the electrons as moving particles then you'll have to figure out a way to finesse this difficulty in depiction. What is most noticeable about the animation will be the least salient facet for reasoning about the electrical loop.

StepHeader{Finally}

With these concerns in mind, there is a simple solution:

TeacherTip{Do not represent the flow of particles in electrical circuits until you can provide supporting evidence and you have a good piece of reasoning to do with the resulting representation, that repays the hard work in getting there.}
