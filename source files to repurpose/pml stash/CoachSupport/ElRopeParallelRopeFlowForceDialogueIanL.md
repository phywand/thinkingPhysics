WebTitle{Thinking through the rope model in parallel circuits}

TeacherOne{I get the rope model for single loops, but struggle with using it for parallel circuits.}

TeacherTwo{Yes&hellip;it seemed convincing in the session, but I'm not so confident about using it. How can one battery have two different flows through it at once?}

TeacherThree{Maybe we're a bit stuck because we're think first about flow, and not about push. }
 
TeacherOne{Yes, yes, I know the battety is not a constant current source, but when Iam puliing the rope through&hellip;}

TeacherTwo{So, is it just a practical issue, or actually a issue with the model?}
 
TeacherThree{So perhaps let's think again about the narrative sequence we use, and then see if it is a conceptual or practical issue.}

TeacherOne{Ok, now what was that sequence?}

CoachComment: This might work well to open up a follow up session on electric circuits, where the rope loop model has been suggested in an earlier session.
