WebTitle{ Is weight best introduced as the pull of gravity?}

TeacherOne{I've got to teach about weight on different planets. Again. How do you introduce it?}

TeacherTwo{I heard someone say QuoteThis{pull of gravity equals weight} very loudly at an IoP meeting, so what choice is there?}

TeacherThree{I prefer to start with their sensations. The more support force they get from the floor(or the bathroom scales), the greater their weight.}

TeacherOne{How do you relate that to changes in planetary gravity?}

TeacherThree{The greater the gravity force, the weight. More support force because of more pull of gravity, if they're to keep still.}

TeacherTwo{So you need the idea of equilibrium.}

TeacherOne{if you focus of the sensation of weight, I suppose its easy to go from there to partial or full weightlessness.}

TeacherTwo{Yes, without getting in a muddle over whether the gravitational force has been altered by the action of the lift floor.}

TeacherThree{Yes, as with many topics in physics, there are choices to be made, and payoffs for the different choices. I think labelling the support force arrow QuoteThis{weight}, and keeping that label separate from the gravity force, acting through the centre of mass, is consistent and helps avoid muddles with weightlessness.}

TeacherOne{I wonder if it would also help with the distinction between mass and weight.}
