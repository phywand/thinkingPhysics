StepHeader{Written summary for Radiations and radiating}

Light, sound, water waves and geological waves all travel from differing sources until dissipated by absorption. Influence is what they carry: no matter makes the trip from source to absorber. These travelling vibrations are characterised by frequency and amplitude, so all models must represent these. The trip times for their journeys depends on their varying speeds; similar speeds suggest a close relationship. All electromagnetic radiations, the focus of much of the work, cover distance of one nanosecond per foot. Rays can be used to predict where beams will go in some cases (reflection, refraction and propagation of light), but are not always useful: wave and trip-time models provide a framework that encompass more phenomena, and go beyond electromagnetic radiations. And there are more models: to work out intensities divide the power of the beam by the areas over which the beam spreads; to account for interference and diffraction use superposition. To find out the energy shifted by a beam of light and to model the interaction with matter re-describe the beam as a stream of photons. A number of models are used: these all relay on wave mathematics, and are further unified in a full quantum description, which is more demanding than the ideas covered here. Two themes emerge: use whatever description allows you to predict and explain; seek out unifying descriptions.

Signals can be sent by using waves: Use a digital code to switch the amplitude of the carrier wave on or off which is a simple digital system. A more sophisticated approach allows the amplitude to have a series of values set by the signal: amplitude modulation. Alternatively use the signal to alter the frequency: frequency modulation. All signals get absorbed and reshaped by what they pass through: regenerating them after this can be a significant challenge in designing a system.

The photon model is fundamental as energy is shifted in lumps, and provides an intelligible model of electromagnetic radiation meeting matter. Absorption, reflection and transmission occur for a constant fraction of the incident photons. Stacking up a series of thicknesses of absorber results in a constant fraction of the photons being removed from the beam by each thickness. Interactions with matter have energy thresholds: high frequency photons can damage a single atom by ionisation; an electron is ejected. These ionising photons damage what they hit: more photons and more interaction per photon both lead to a greater dose (J/kg). The necessary high-energy photons can come from an individual nucleus (gamma) or accelerated charge (X-rays).

High-speed particles, particularly if highly charged, also ionise. Some plough in through the atmosphere  and we’re unsure of the origins of many of these cosmic particles but others come from nuclei. Beams of ionising particles can be produced by particle accelerators.  The study of radioactive materials started by characterising the properties of the particles emitted by the nucleus, using detectors relying on the ionisation caused. As a consequence of particle emission, the nucleus changed, and new elements formed. The ultimate transmutations are fission, where a high mass nucleus splits into two more, lower mass nuclei, or the converse process: fusion. Each can result in less mass, with a consequent shifting of energy that can be exploited. All these spontaneous processes can only happen once per nucleus, having a constant chance of happening in each second, and leaving one less nucleus in the sample. Removing a constant fraction results in constant fractional decay of the activity, or number of emissions a second. Thus radioactive materials become safer at a decreasing rate. We cannot change that rate.

Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.
