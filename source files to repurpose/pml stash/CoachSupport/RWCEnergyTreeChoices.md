WebTitle{The energy choice tree}

That energy is a calculated quantity should be a touchstone. Its all to easy to lay tripwires around this simple principle in ways that deflect children from a journey heading towards that idea.

Mechanism and narrative stories are comforting, and a common explanatory structure. But energy is a constraint on what’s possible, so stands aside from this narrative structure. 

However the lived-in world is, the world of scientific reasoning that we’re trying to account for is not of the lived-in world,  and much of it is not built of this kind of explanatory structure. (First this, then that: as a direct consequence. Characteristed as linear sequential reasoning in the literature – and yes it does demonstrable damage to children's abilities to reason in the sciences when inappropriately deployed).


The teaching of energy should respect this distinction, after all energy is the ultimate QuoteThis{limiting factor}, and should be seen as such.

So what seems a simple question:

JustSpeak{How does the energy change?}

Is really three questions, and rather often conflated. We need to disambiguate, to clarify, to help children's thinking.

ListSequence
- How? SymbolArrowright how much?
- How? SymbolArrowright how quickly?
- How? SymbolArrowright how does it work?

JustSpeak{How much, or at what rate, or by what mechanism?}

ListSequence
- How much?  SymbolArrowright is about energy. Quaitative: stores. Quantiative: joules.
- How quickly?   SymbolArrowright is about power (the rate of accumulation or depletion). Quaitative: pathways. Quantiative: watts.
- How does it work? SymbolArrowright is not an energy question at all. It is a request for a mechanism, and should be identified as such.

The third is not an energy description (it belongs to a different semiotic register) although it may be useful in identifying calculations that might be insightful, and so denote fruitful qualitative descriptions in identifying stores and pathways.

Because power is about what’s happening, it’s easier to see connections to mechanisms, and perhaps segue into discussions of those mechanisms. So pahways may be QuoteThis{felt to be} closer to mechanisms, and this is often correct. But its not the case that if you have a mechansim, then add anything by calling it a QuoteThis{pathway}, even if you add a qualifying adjective.

A key test for any proposed description is:

JustSpeak{How are children expected to represent the core ideas to themselves and how can the reason with these representations to form predictive mental models, as simulacra of scientific descriptions}.

This test helps to avoid creating QuoteThis{magic word} games, of not teaching the sciences.

TeacherTip{Pathways and stores earn their keep because they are collections of qualitative descriptions standing in for calculations that are actually done.}
