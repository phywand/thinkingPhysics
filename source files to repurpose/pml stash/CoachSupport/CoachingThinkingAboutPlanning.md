WebTitle{ Thinking about planning }

Some suggested essentials for keeping in mind whilst planning a CPD session

ThinkHeader{Making physics connect}

* to children's concerns
* to the lived-in world.

ThinkHeader{Providing tools to think with}

* representing and reasoning to enable children to make predictions
* use calculation and semi-qualitative reasoning

ThinkHeader{Making explicit links}

* to children's existing ideas
* to future learning pathways
* to other topics in physics
* to other disciplines

ThinkHeader{Exploiting physical experiences}

* sensing (physicists both notice and record)
* intervening (physicists prepare situations skilfully, coaxing nature to reveal her hidden patterns in reproducible ways)

Having these in mind that teaching physics should include these four facets will allow you to give them due weight  when planning a session or sequence.
