StepHeader{Written summary for Machines}

Machines connect input forces with output forces, perhaps multiplying the input force, but paying for that by demanding that the input force move a greater distance than the output force. Energy is conserved by machines: there is simply a trade-off between force and distance moved by the force (ProductABC{energy shifted}{force}{distance}). If one is increased, then the other is correspondingly decreased.

Levers and hydraulic machines are simple. Both rely on the properties of the linking material to connect the input force to the output force. For levers choose a stiff material; for hydraulics a comparatively incompressible  fluid. Moments are calculated quantities that link input and output forces for levers (ProductABC{moment}{length}{force}): a neat trick that enables one to design levers without having to think about energy conservation. Pressure fulfils the same function as moment for machines where the input and output forces are linked by fluids. But there is more. Pressure also describes a state of the fluid (the pressure in the fluid), just like the temperature (the temperature of the fluid). The higher the pressure, the more its molecules bombard the constraining surface, so the higher the force that can be supported by that surface (ProductABC{force}{pressure}{area}).

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
