WebTitle{ Tripping en route from one model to another}

TeacherOne{I've just about persuaded them that light travels in straight lines along rays.}

TeacherTwo{I thought our SoW said QuoteThis{beams} not QuoteThis{rays}, but I cannot remember why.}

TeacherThree{The rays are a conceptual model to reason with, the beams show what we can make visible by scattering some of the light on its way from source to detector, so they are a physical description.}

TeacherOne{Whatever&mdash;but light does go in straight lines, right?}

TeacherTwo{Where there is no change in the medium, yes.}

TeacherOne{OK, but now apparently I have to make it even more complicated: light travelling in straight lines, but as little bullets. So photons.}

TeacherTwo{Hang on a minute&hellip;}

TeacherOne{So I've got to picture these little blobs of energy travelling along the rays&mdash;sorry QuoteThis{beams}.}

TeacherTwo{That's not how I see it: I think there's more of a change than that when you change the model.}

TeacherThree{You can only be sure of a photon where it is emitted or absorbed&mdash;that is at source or detector. Remember the message of the experiment with the chalk dust in the beam?}

TeacherOne{So rays are wrong and light does something else altogether?}

TeacherThree{It's not that cut and dried: there are several ways of predicting beams, and the many-paths photon model is different from the ray model: you're heading off down the wrong track if you run them together. It's just like when you were helping me over the expression of genes, muddling up nature and nurture: they are both about the development of individuals but consider different factors. Each has its use and place in making predictions.}
