WebTitle{Ideas preferred to misconceptions}


ThinkHeader{I'm with John Locke}

QuoteThis{Ideas} is a useful word.

StepHeader{You can have ideas about:}

- What is happening: Noticing matters of fact.
- How something is happening: Recording what is going on.
- Why something is happening: Explaining and predicting.

And an idea does not sound very grand: it could be anything from an inkling to a full-blown thesis. This is an advantage, because any detailed reading of the 'misconceptions' research reveals that children's ideas are quite pliable and context dependent. Unlike the intra-personal project that is physics, a child's personal store of what, why and how tools does not seem to be overly concerned with either coherence or consistency.

A conception is such an overblown term that adding adjectives seems superfluous. It carries a heft that is ill-suited to describing children's representing and reasoning in physics classrooms. Maybe we'd be better off with a term that is even more transient than idea: not an QuoteThis{inkling}, but a QuoteThis{pencilling}.

StepHeader{Reasons for caring}

QuoteThis{Misconceptions} has become a catch-all term. It's about as useful to an analysis as QuoteThis{friction}. It's become degraded through usage: usually covering so much ground that it serves no useful purpose. In the current discourse about pupil and teacher learning it's  become a label to avoid analysis, rather than a spur to action.

Here are two examples...

QuoteThis{Find out what the misconceptions are and teach accordingly} (a sad truncation of Ausubel).

QuoteThis{I usually find out the teachers misconceptions and start from there} (Quote from supporters group on TalkPhysics).

Idea is such a demotic word that it invites adjectives, so encouraging further analysis. QuoteThis{Is that a good or bad idea?} and  QuoteThis{Is that a helpful or unhelpful idea} both  sound plausible pieces of classroom dialogue. The use of the term idea in planning and preparing, and in executing, removes an unnecessary piece of translating from generating the expectations for, or the reflections on, the lesson. I do hope that that QuoteThis{That's a misconception}, or (possibly even more painful on the ear) QuoteThis{That's a good /bad, helpful/ unhelpful alternative conception} are not appealing phrases to deploy in the classroom.

StepHeader{Ideas in SPT}

SPT does not list misconceptions, preferring the more malleable connotations of QuoteThis{Wrong track} and QuoteThis{Right lines}. This also allows us to spell out what the helpful and unhelpful paths look and sound like, often in their nascent phases.

ThinkHeader{Look out for these}

WrongTrack{What unhelpful paths look and sound like.}

RightLines{What helpful paths look and sound like.}
