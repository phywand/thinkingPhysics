WebTitle{ Who flies this thing whilst we eat?}

TeacherOne{It must be a bit anti-social at mealtimes on the international space station.}

TeacherTwo{What makes you say that? I suppose they choose people who are good at getting along.}

TeacherOne{I mean, they can't all sit down and eat together.}

TeacherTwo{Why ever not?}

TeacherOne{Well, someone's got to fly it.}

TeacherTwo{It's not a plane, there's no air to fly in.}

TeacherOne{That's not the point, someone has to steer it round the Earth.}

TeacherTwo{It does not need that kind of steering.}

TeacherOne{Why ever not? I have to steer my car around corners. Are you saying it has an autopilot?}

TeacherTwo{Not even one of those&mdash;it just does not need steering: it's in free fall.}

TeacherOne{What? It's going round the Earth, not falling towards it: the pilot controls the flight path.}

TeacherThree{ There are quite a few things to sort out here&hellip;}
