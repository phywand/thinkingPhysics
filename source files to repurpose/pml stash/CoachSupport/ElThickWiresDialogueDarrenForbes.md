WebTitle{Thicker wires and resistance}
 
TeacherOne{I've been trying to explain why thicker wires have less resistance than thin ones but I don’t get it.}
 
TeacherTwo{What type of explanation have you been using?}

TeacherOne{Well it’s all about there being more space in the wire for the electrons to get through isn’t it. Less collisions between them means less resistance doesn’t it?}

TeacherTwo{But I thought it was something do there being more electrons moving through the wire. The thicker it is the more electrons there are in the wire so it’s a bigger current.}

TeacherOne{Eh? But if there are more of the electrons there will be more collisions won’t there so that means more resistance.}

TeacherTwo{But the wire is thicker so there is more space for those extra electrons to move.}

TeacherOne{I’m just not sure about what the resistance really is. Is it really to do with collisions?. I’m not getting the space thing. Is there really distance between the atoms?}

TeacherTwo{I think we need to say why the electrons are moving in the first place. Do they travel faster or slower in thicker wires?}
