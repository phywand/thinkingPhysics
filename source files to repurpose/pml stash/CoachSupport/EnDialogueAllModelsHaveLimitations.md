WebTitle{ QuoteThis{All models have their limitations}


TeacherTwo{I'm not sure I get the reason why we have to change the way we talk about energy. My kids get the grades.}

TeacherOne{I read what was on the blog too, and I've heard that others have been using it for a while, and find that it makes good sense.}

TeacherTwo{ But all models have their limitations, don't they?}

TeacherThree{I've heard you say that before, and I'm still not sure why you raise it or what  you mean by it.}

TeacherTwo{Well, it's true. Surely you're not denying that?}

TeacherOne{For some value of QuoteThis{true}, if we're really having a meta-physical  discussion.}

TeacherThree{But why are you raising it here? Is it that you think any model will do? Surely the important question for us is simply QuoteThis{What's the best way of reasoning about energy with young children?}}

TeacherOne{And how does that change with the capabilities of the children as they develop.}

TeacherThree{Agreed. And the reasons we have we ought to share, rooted both in the representation of the physics (so didactic transpositions) and in the ideas that we have to work on.}

TeacherOne{So do you have reasons why your model of energy is a better one than the one in SPT?}
