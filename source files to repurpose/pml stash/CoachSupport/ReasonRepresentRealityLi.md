StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: the source-medium-detector set}

The first reasoning is done with the the source-medium-detector set of representations, essential as a foundation because it emphasises that the beam links source and detector, and that something must travel.

The phenomena used to explore the properties of lighting enable this representational set to be elaborated using the idea of a ray, that can be drawn to predict where there will be beams.

InsertGraphic{RRRLiRaysSeeingPID}{600}{610}

Represent a process(reasoning):

- a ray is drawn (from source to X)

With the consequence (prediction):

- there is a beam from source to X

This beam has an effect (phenomena):

- X is lit by the source/X is illuminated by the source

You can elaborate what is going on theoretically as (further representing and reasoning):

- light travels from source to X (I'm not sure this is very helpful)
- electromagnetic waves travel from source to X
- photons emitted by the source could be absorbed at X

You can relate this to a sense(seeing):

- you can see the source if your eye (as a detector) is placed at X.

StepHeader{What the elaborated set is made of: constituents}

- source as origin of drawn rays
- rules for drawing rays
- detector where rays end

StepHeader{What the set can do: capabilities}

- predict path of beams
- predict shadows

As it stands, the set needs ad-hoc rules adding to it to  account for reflection, the formation of images, or refraction. Later these ad-hoc rules can in turn be accounted for using a different representational set, and different patterns of reasoning.

StepHeader{What the set can have done to it: changes}

- vary the medium
- vary the location and separation of source and detector
- vary what lies between source and detector

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the set}

- where it will be light or dark
- where power will be switched

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope for the set}

- seeing
- reflection of light
- refraction of light

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- no common patterns

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- geometrical reasoning

StepHeader{Future developments for the set}

- multiple sources and contributions

StepHeader{Auxiliary reasoning and representing}

The phenomena associated with colour are not accounted for by the ray description, so additional reasoning s needed to deal with those phenomena, such as:

- absorption of light
- colours, perceptual and spectral

On a first visit, these are reasoned about using ad-hoc rules. There is a simple connection between a single frequency and spectral colour, but not between mixtures of frequencies and perceptual colour.
