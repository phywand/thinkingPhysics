This page provides a starting point for preparing for assembling sessions and guides (to prepare for or follow up on those sessions).

StepHeader{Written summary for Sound}

Sound travels as vibrations from source to detector. How loud the sound appears depends on the amplitude of the vibrations striking the ear. The pitch heard depends on the frequency of the vibrations. This range of frequencies is called a spectrum.

Crucially, unlike light, we can hear vibrations of different frequencies at the same time, rather than reporting a range of frequencies arriving as one colour, which is the case for light. So there are strong similarities with light: both travel as vibrations, of different frequencies (detected as pitch or colour) and amplitudes (detected as loudness or brightness). One significant difference is that sound needs a medium in which to travel: the vibrations are repeated changes in density of that medium. The speed varies with what the vibrations are travelling through: this is true for light also. Sound however, travels very much more slowly. Rays are not such a useful model for sound, as the paths followed by sound from source to detector are not so sharply defined: sound spreads out more rather than travelling in beams.

ThinkHeader{For the topic}

* hearing is all about the source-medium-detector model
* measuring and describing sound is all about amplitude and loudness, frequency and pitch
* ranging and speed is all about speed, frequency and wavelength

ThinkHeader{So 01 – Describing sound}

* hearing and sound
* source-medium-detector
* pitch and loudness as perceptions

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
