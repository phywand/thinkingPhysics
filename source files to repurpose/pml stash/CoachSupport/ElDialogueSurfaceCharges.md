WebTitle{ Puzzles about why current goes round bends}

TeacherOne{OK, so I know that the current is the same everywhere in the electrical loop, but what drives it?}

TeacherTwo{Surely that's simple &mdash;it's just that charge is pushed and pulled around the circuit by the concentration of charges on the terminals of the battery.}

TeacherOne{But I thought concentrations of charge could only happen on the surface of conductors, and yet the current is in the conductor. So what pushes it along there? And what about the bends in the circuit &mdash;how do the charges on the battery terminals push one way, then the other when the wire changes direction?}

TeacherTwo{I see what you mean &mdash;if the wire snakes down the table in a series of QuoteThis{S shapes}, then the current follows the wire, but the force from the charges on the terminals only gets weaker &mdash;it does not switch to and fro.  It must be a bit more complicated than I supposed.}

TeacherOne{Well, we know about charged cylinders, where the charge is all on the outside. Those must be a good starting point for thinking about wires. And we know that batteries are just chemical charge pumps, so we ought to be able to put together an explanation.}
