WebTitle{Charge is a property, not a thing}

TeacherOne{I've read that we shouldn't be talking about charges.}

TeacherTwo{Why ever not?}

TeacherOne{Well, you can't get just charge &mdash;only charged objects or particles.}

TeacherThree{But surely I can use QuoteThis{charge}?}

TeacherOne{That seems OK , so you're referring to the physical quantity.}

TeacherTwo{So QuoteThis{charge} is OK, but not QuoteThis{charges}?}

TeacherOne{QuoteThis{Charges} seems to about things, and maybe a shorthand for charged particles. But it suggests that might be such a thing as charge without an object to carry the charge.}

TeacherThree{That's important, because children tend to reason as if charge can be drawn or painted onto things, which rather undermines the conservation of charge.}

TeacherOne{The safe suggestion seems to talk about physical charge as the measure, and charged particles or charged objects as the things.}

TeacherTwo{I suppose we ought to be equally careful with mass, which seems to be the other physical quantity that's most likely to cause similar confusion.}
