WebTitle{ Reasoning about broken circuits with rope loops}

TeacherOne{I find that the rope model does not offer any insight into circuits with a break, either deliberate breaks using a switch or accidental breaks due to  poor wiring skills.}

TeacherTwo{My classes always suggest the resistance of the gap is zero QuotationThis{because there is nothing there}.}

TeacherOne{But that cannot be right, because a smaller flow is the result of a higher resistance. In this case there is a EmphasiseThis{very} small flow, so the resistance in the loop must be very high.}

TeacherTwo{But there is no loop&hellip;}

TeacherThree{Well, you have to decide whether to stick with trying to reason with what is to hand, or to create a new way of reasoning. Here I think it's best to stick with the loop, as the line of reasoning will also be useful in thinking about fuses, earthing and electrical safetyâ€”in these cases we put a near-insulator in a the loop: a human.}

TeacherTwo{OK, so if there is a loop, then putting an air gap into the loop reduces the flow to effectively zero, suggesting that the gap is a near-infinite resistance. That looks like a good QuotationThis{What happens in the limit} argument, and I can see that working, so long as I approach it by a series of intermediate steps.}

TeacherOne{I'n not seen it like that before. I just thought of the cut loop as a separate case, and had not made the connection. But it's a line of thinking that seems worth a try with my classes.}
