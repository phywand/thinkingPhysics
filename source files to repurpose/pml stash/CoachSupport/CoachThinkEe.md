This page provides a starting point for preparing for assembling sessions and guides (to prepare for or follow up on those sessions).

StepHeader{Written summary for Electricity and energy}

Assembling an electrical loop means making choices about the potential difference (often provided by a battery) and the resistance (often provided by one or more bulbs and resistors, with series connections). These choices jointly determine the current and form the foundation block for analysing circuits, as where you have parallel connections you can (and should) simply treat them a two linked loops.

Simple loop analysis provides a toolkit to explore – Why we settled PhysicalQuantity{230}{volt} for domestic usage; fuses and mains circuits.

Electrical loops are used to accumulate energy in stores, where the power switched from the electrical working pathway by a particular device (bulb, heater, loudspeaker, motor) determines the target store (and often also fills stores which are not targeted—dissipation is almost unavoidable).

In some cases these devices are electromagnetic, where the being able to predict a force where field lines straighten or shorten provides a unifying approach. Generators and transformers follow.

Focussing on either  power or energy, tracking where one has been shifted, or the other switched, allows you to calculate efficiencies. Use the idea of accumulation to link these two perspectives.

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
