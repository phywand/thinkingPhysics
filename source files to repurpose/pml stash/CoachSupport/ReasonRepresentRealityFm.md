StepHeader{Starting points}

This topic draws on the following 11&ndash;14 topics, so all of the tools for reasoning and representing from those topics are available as starting points.

StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: Force  and acceleration are constrained}

This is not a good representation of the lived-in world: force mass and acceleration are not disconnected. There is a constraint relationships between them.

The world is better represented like this:

In the underlying rule constrains the possibilities: F, m and a cannot have values varying independently. That's what the equals sign means in:

FractionBdCeqA{acceleration}{force}{mass}

This kind of discovery: that there are constrains between physical quantities is a big deal.

StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: Kinematics}

Firstly it si important to be careful with representing quantites – we recommend a principled and thought-through set of arrows for clarity

Acceleration accumulates velocity:

Velocity accumulates displacement

Force accumulates momentum:

The pattern is common, and maybe that's the really important thing.

StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: Interacting objects}

Forces come in pairs: separate out interacting objects from their environment.

The forces change the momenta of the masses, leading to conservation of momentum.
