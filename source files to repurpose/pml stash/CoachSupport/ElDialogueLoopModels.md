WebTitle{ Making models for loops}

TeacherOne{I had a great lesson today: I talked about the water heating circuit and then the kids made up models of their own for electricity.}

TeacherTwo{Sounds interesting&mdash;did you give them any guidance?}

TeacherOne{Just that they should use their imagination.}

TeacherTwo{So what next?}

TeacherOne{We'll, I thought we'd add more bulbs to the circuits.}

TeacherTwo{No, I meant what next for their models?}

TeacherOne{Nothing really, it was good to get them thinking.}

TeacherThree{But don't you think they've been short-changed. After all, they might like to know if their models are any good.}

TeacherOne{Yes, how are they supposed to decide? After all some of their QuoteThis{models} might be good ways of picturing what's going on, but not representations that they can QuoteThis{run forward} in their minds, so as to be able to make predictions and acquire a feeling of mastery.}

TeacherThree{I'm afraid I think it's more than a bit dangerous to get children to build their own models where they don't have a good grasp of the phenomena that they're trying to model. In fact, they're quite likely to notice processes that aren't there, or aren't significant, because their faulty model is misleading them.}

TeacherTwo{I just think you've set yourself up for some hard lessons. It seems to me that it's going to be pretty tough theorising to present a good picture of HSW without digging into those models.}
