WebTitle{Representing and reasoning, not models}

WrongTrack{All models have limitations}

This is, in a coaching scenario, not much use to those you are trying to help, and also not so helpful as talk between coaches. In both cases because all the helpful detail is hidden by this bland assertion. Unless you spell out what he limitations are, it is really disengaging. And it's not fruitful in developing teaching. Apart from repeating the phrase to the children, what can teachers do with this opinion? It more or less reports a dead end, and little more. No clues are given about how to switch from this model to whatever follows. To me, it feels like a cop-out, not an act of coaching that encourages engagement. That's because what lies behind the statement is a whole cornucopia of possibilities, none of which are clearly signalled.

RightLines{How do we suggest children represent a particular quantity, and how do we hope that children will reason with these representations, and what insights might they gain?}

Explication trumps oversimplification! By spelling out in detail what you hope for the teacher stands a chance of transitioning from this set of representations and associated reasoning to another in a way that shows how physics progresses, rather than tectonic shifts from one model to another without enabling teaches to share reasons fro changes with children.
