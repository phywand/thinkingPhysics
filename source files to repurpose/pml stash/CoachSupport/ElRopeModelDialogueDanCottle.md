WebTitle{Using the Rope Model for 11-14 year olds}

TeacherOne{I was teaching Y7 about series and parallel circuits and I found using the rope model quite difficult.}

TeacherTwo{Really? I normally go straight into building circuits first so they can get their hands on some practical work and see the relevance to real life}

TeacherOne{I guess I just wanted them to get the right idea about how current flows right from the start so I didn’t reinforce any wrong ideas}

TeacherTwo{That seems like a good idea - did you have any problems with it?}

TeacherOne{Well - classroom management wise it was difficult to get the students to be sensible when pulling on the rope but once I got that sorted they were surprised that the rope moved through a bulb straight away when the ‘cell’ started pulling it.}

TeacherTwo{Why do you think that was?}

TeacherOne{I think it is because when they leave primary school, students are pretty convinced that electricity comes from the battery and the key idea we are trying to get across is that electrons are always present in the circuit and the battery makes them move in the same direction.}

TeacherTwo{I might try that next time I teach it - just before going into circuit building.}

TeacherTip{This conversation is to stimulate a discussion about the purpose of using the rope model and some considerations about using it in the classroom}
