StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: PoV and moving object pair}

The main tool for reasoning is an object seen from a chosen point of view (PoV).

StepHeader{What the the PoV and moving object pair is made of: constituents}

- a chosen point of view
- a moving object

StepHeader{What the the PoV and moving object pair can do: capabilities}

- accumulate kinematic quantities

StepHeader{What the PoV and moving object pair can have done to it: changes}

- a different point of view
- changing the relative movement

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the PoV and moving object pair}

- predicting relative movements

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope  for the PoV and moving object pair}

- relative movements of all kinds

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- accumulation relationships
-  proportionality (as a special example of a constraint relationship: often to look at the average values of a motion that has happened or will happen, rather than one that is happening )

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- semi-quantitative reasoning

StepHeader{Future developments for the PoV and moving object pair}

- multiple accumulations
- link with dynamics
