WebTitle{Coaching in the Mo topic}

This page provides a starting point for preparing for assembling sessions and guides (to prepare for or follow up on those sessions).

StepHeader{Written summary for the topic}

Noticing a motion, perhaps something approaching or receding from you depends on you taking a point of view. So all motion is relative motion: there are changes relative to a location—in both position(distance) and in clock time(duration). The rate of change of distance with duration is speed. Often we don't mention the point of view, but it's always there and sometimes this omission can cause difficulties.

Motion is changed by the action of a resultant force. Calculate the resultant force acting on the object by adding together all of the force arrows that have been identified as being exerted tend by the environment, acting on the object. The change in motion of the object is proportional to this force. If this were not so, then the study of forces would not be so important. Together with the mass of the object the resultant force determines the acceleration: this may set the change in speed in each unit of time.

You can invert this line of reasoning: make several measurements of the speed, see if it changes, and use that as a hint to see if there is a resultant force acting on the object. This result may drive a search for more forces exerted by the environment.

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
