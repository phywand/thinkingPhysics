StepHeader{Written summary for Light}

Light travels from source to detector. If our eye is that detector, then we see the object from which the light has come. If not, then the object is invisible to us. The object may be luminous, emitting its own light or non-luminous, relying on reflected light to be seen. For all objects we can model and so predict what light will do when it hits the object by using rays.

For all reflected rays the angle of incidence is equal the angle of reflection. If the surface is highly polished then it will be smooth, so rays hitting adjacent parts of the surface will head off ordered just as they arrived. For rougher surfaces this will not be the case. So in some surfaces we can see clear images, in others not as the light comes out jumbled, as predicted by the rays heading off in all directions, in turn due to the surface being rough.

Light will also meet different substances on its travels, and will not always be reflected: it may be transmitted or absorbed. Here is is more fruitful not to represent this with the individual rays, rather to think about the incident power shared out amongst the different possibilities. If the substance is transparent then most of the power is transmitted, and the light stays ordered. If translucent, then at least some power is transmitted but the light is no longer necessarily ordered. If opaque, then no power, or almost no power is transmitted. Power that is not transmitted or reflected will contribute to an accumulation of energy in a thermal store, warming the substance—a process known as absorption).

Light that is transmitted may be refracted: the rays that predict its path are bent at the surfaces of the substance. Just as with reflection, that adjacent rays are refracted differently leads to a disordering of the light, and this can make objects translucent only, rather than transparent. However even if adjacent rays are dealt with identical ways, because the surface of the substance is smooth, and the interior is homogeneous, different colours may appear. Light travels as a vibration, and each frequency of light corresponds to a different spectral colour. By shaping the substance into we can separate light into its spectral colours.

Different objects reflect different fractions of these frequencies and so appear to be different perceptual colours to us.

Different frequencies may have different fractions absorbed by a substance: in that case the substance can be used as a colour filter.

All the colours that we see can be reproduced by combinations of three base perceptual colours: the three colour theory of vision.

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
