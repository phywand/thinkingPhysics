WebTitle{Depicting photons}

A beam of light, on the nanoscale, could be pictured as a stream of photons.

But, and it turns out to be a big but, anything apart from the emitting and detecting is inferential. There is very good evidence that emission and absorption happen in chunks. However, we simply don't have any evidence for granularity in transit. How could we have? As soon as you detect a photon – it's destroyed, so you cannot spot it in transit.

Photons really are quantum objects, with all that this implies.

Does it matter? Does the idea of stream of photons do any damage – well, yes.

It leads to people having an image of photons as little QuoteThis{bulletty} things streaming from source to detector along well-defined trajectories. And the quantum world uncovered by over a century of research is just is not like that, so it's a cultural disservice.

But worse follows. Because the quantum of energy, the graininess of the accumulation or deletion of stores is calculated by GroupBlock{QuantitySymbol{h} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{f}}, people are led to think that the photon is well thought of as a little QuoteThis{bulletty} store. From that, since illuminating beams are the bulk manifestation of many photons, people are led to thinking of light as an energy store, which is a deeply unhelpful, if seductive, move.
