StepHeader{Written summary for Energy}

Energy is conserved quantity: energy can be shifted from store to store, with none of it lost as it is shifted. Many processes are associated with energy shifting from store to a store or to many stores. You can see if a process is possible by calculating the energy in a store beforehand, and then deciding whether the energy in the stores after the proposed process is equal to or less than this initial value ( by doing further calculations). If so then the process may happen. If not, then the process is absolutely impossible.

Yet, in spite of being conserved, if energy is shifted from one store to many, it may be harder to do useful things next time the energy is shifted, so energy can be dissipated. Here the same quantity of energy is spread amongst many stores, each containing a little, rather than being concentrated in rather fewer larger stores, each somewhat fuller.

So a description in terms of energy is possible only if you are very clear about the process, and you clearly identify starting and ending points. You need a clear physical description to generate a worthwhile description in terms of energy. There are only a few stores (chemical, gravity, kinetic, thermal, elastic, vibration, nuclear, electric and magnetic), and the clues to look for changes to these stores are also rather simple. So even if you cannot do the calculations, you can identify the stores, given a limited choice to work from. This is the second stage in developing an energy description.

Later one might think about how the energy gets to be shifted to or from the stores. Then one is thinking about pathways. There are four of these that are prominent at this stage: mechanical working (forces topic), electrical working (electricity and magnetism topic), heating by molecules and heating by radiation (energy topic). Each has a particular mechanism associated with the calculation that is done to work out by how much the store of energy should be incremented or decremented(a positive or negative accumulation).

To quantify the accumulated changes in the stores, the thickness of arrows in Sankey diagrams show how much energy is shifting. That the total thickness of all the arrows on one diagram is constant shows that energy is conserved.

The distinction between energy and temperature is linked to the quantity of matter associated with each thermal store. To have the same quantity of energy spread over a larger number of particles results in a lower temperature.

Convection, conduction and evaporation are examples of the pathway QuoteThis{heating by particles}, where the rapidly-moving particles are directly involved in the shifting of the energy. In the  first and last the fast particles move, taking the energy with them. In conduction the energy is shifted by one particle acting directly on its neighbours. The pathway QuoteThis{heating by radiation} gives a way of describing the shifting of energy by electromagnetic radiation.

StepHeader{Core ideas listed as bullet points}

ThinkHeader{For the topic}

- any teaching model is about quantifying energy shifted: joules everywhere
- energy descriptions are always from snapshot to snapshot
- calculable stores, when there is a state of the system
- dissipation and conservation need modelling
- calculable pathways for what's still happening, so power is about energy shifting
- energy and temperature

ThinkHeader{En01 – Paying for getting things done}

- energy as essentially quantitative
- introduced with numerical examples
- energy limits what is possible as it is a conserved quantity
- power and energy

ThinkHeader{En02 – Shifting energy between stores}

- stores as the placeholders for calculations
- a model of energy
- separating the physical from the energy description
- generating clear physical descriptions to get clear energy descriptions

ThinkHeader{En03 – Energy resources and pathways}

- pathways are about power
- fuels and resources are both depleted
- avoiding representing chains

ThinkHeader{En04 – Calculating energy everywhere}

- calculations inform about possibilities
- energy calculations do not tell you what will happen
- energy calculations do tell you what cannot happen

ThinkHeader{En05 – Warming and cooling}

- distinguishing between energy and temperature
- avoiding describing heat as a substance, especially one that can rise

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.
