WebTitle{Avoiding Mission Creep}

Energy is a calculable quantity, not a tangible quantity. Power shares these characteristics. So any qualitative representations of, and patterns of reasoning using, these quantities should respect such charactersistics. There is nothing in this restriction that prevents you developing complementary accounts of a process in terms of mechanisms, but such descriptions are not an energy description, although they might guide the energy descriptions by helping to identify stores or pathways.

TeacherTip{If it's not about representing calculations joules or watts, its not an energy or power description, so not about stores or pathways.}

ThinkHeader{A checklist for qualitative energy descriptions, based in the reality of energy as a calculable quantity}


StepHeader{The why}

- Develop an energy description of a change if you'll gain insights from calculating energy changes.

StepHeader{The how}

- Select two snapshots to bound the change you want to study, describing each carefully.
- To select stores, identify some physical changes which suggest that you'll be able to calculate the energy shifted to or from that store.
- To quantify the energy shifted to or from each store, estimate or calculate. The result in in joules.

StepHeader{Reality check}

- State the insights the description yielded.


ThinkHeader{A checklist for qualitative power descriptions, based in the reality of power as a directly calculable quantity}

TeacherTip{So excluding FractionABC{power}{energy}{time}, as for that route you'd be developing  a qualitative energy description as a aprecursor to doing the calculations.'}

StepHeader{The why}

- Develop a power description of a process if you'll gain insights from calculating power.

StepHeader{The how}

- Identify the process you want to study, describing it carefully.
- To select pathways, identify some physical changes which suggest that you'll be able to calculate the power in the pathway or switched to or from the pathway.
- To quantify the power in the pathway or switched to or from a pathway, estimate or calculate. The result is in watts.

StepHeader{Reality check}
- State the insights the description yielded.

ThinkHeader{About mechanisms, for a richer physical description}

TeacherTip{None of these are essential to identifying the store or pathway, and they are not the store or the pathway. So let’s not conflate mechanism with store or pathway.}

- Describe the physical mechanisms that underpin how the power is switched, or how the energy is stored.
- This will constain adn likley develop particular topic-based knowledge, but is not about energy.
- There is nothing preventing you from develping these, as you always have. Just represent the science clearly by keeping these separate from descriptions that are precursors to one-step calculations with answers in joules  or watts.



TeacherTip{Deeper structural point: energy and power are not causal: they are constraints on possibilities – appropriate calculations  tell you what cannot happen. So energy or power descriptions are the ultimate QauoteThis{limiting factors}:  neither are efficient causes.}
