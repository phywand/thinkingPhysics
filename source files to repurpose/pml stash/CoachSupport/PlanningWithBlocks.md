WebTitle{Assembling plans and guides}

StepHeader{Plans}

Coaches assemble sessions from chances, which are here represented as SessionBlocks: selected to enable a focus on one of probing, showing or telling. These blocks will often require an activity, which will need to be separately documented, so that the SessionBlocks can link to them.

Each SessionBlock has a title, an optional link, scores for each of the four coaching facets, a guideline duration, and a coaching comment.

Example with link:
``` markdown
SessionBlock {The funny one where the bits wobble. Or The funny one where the bits wobble. Or not}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/coach}{1330}{My coaching notes such as they are, or are not, and what I hope to achieve.}{25}
```
SpacingLinebreak
Example without link:
``` markdown
SessionBlockNoLink {The funny one where the bits wobble}{1330}{My coaching notes such as they are, or are not, and what I hope to achieve.}{25}
```
SpacingLinebreak

StepHeader{Guides}

Can be thought of as built of blocks consisting of a link  or heading, plus commentary, so are constructed of a series of:

```markdown
GuideBlock {title}{link}{comment}
GuideBlockNoLink {title}{comment}
```

StepHeader{Finding and managing blocks}

Coaches can identify blocks from resources on TalkPhysics:

- The SPN review of practice
- Sessions shared by TLC in the coaching practice group

InsertLinkPN{TalkPhysics}{http://talkphysics.org}

Coaches can exploit these resources to create blocks to assemble into sessions, or find links to share for guides, with confidence:

InsertLinkPN{Supporting Physics Teaching(SPT)}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/}

JustSpeak{Distilled research findings, worked through teaching sequences(5-16) }

InsertLinkPN{Teaching Advanced Physics(TAP}{http://iop.org/tap}

JustSpeak{As on the tin: supporting those starting out on teaching A level}


InsertLinkPN{Teacher Subject Specialism Training (TSST)}{http://www.iop.org/education/ltp/established/tsst-classroom-resources/index.html}

JustSpeak{Actually CPD resources, in spite of the label and URL}

InsertLinkPN{Practical Physics}{http://practicalphysics.org}

JustSpeak{Where to put the sealing wax and string to make physics convincing}

And will need to tread more carefully in using either of these:

- Existing practice, once moderated by exposure to wider evidence
- A web search, filtered by wisdom

ThinkHeader{How can the blocks be organised?}

* to enable them to be found
* To enable new ones to be incorporated
* To encourage the submission of new ones
- How can organised selections of blocks be shared, so others can adapt them?
