WebTitle{Deciding about consistency}

TeacherOne{Surely we should be consistent and refer to either QuoteThis{charge flows} or QuoteThis{charges that flow}.}

TeacherTwo{I'm not so sure, they seem to be the  beginnings of different arguments to me.}

TeacherOne{How's that, then?}

TeacherTwo{Well, QuoteThis{charge flow} is about the macroscopic, the whole loop{QuoteThis{charges flow} focusses on the physical mechanism.}

TeacherOne{Hmm...What do you mean by the QuoteThis{physical mechanism}?}

TeacherTwo{Well, I'd start with the phrase QuoteThis{charges flow} if I was going to go on to construct a model of what was going on inside the wires, or in the ionic fluids, in a particular part of the circuit.}

TeacherOne{I can see how that'd work, but what about the other one?}

TeacherTwo{Oh, I'd start there if I was going to discuss the macroscopic, focussing on the circuit as a system (although I'd never use that form of words with pupils.)}

TeacherOne{I suppose that's just an excuse to head for the rope loop model.}

TeacherTwo{Well, SPT convinces me that it's a good basis for a predictive model.}

TeacherOne{But are you sure that your beloved SPT is really consistent about the two approaches?}

TeacherThree{I think(2013-10-08) there's some checking to be done there. Update (2018-05-23): It was so.}
