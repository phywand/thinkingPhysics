WebTitle{A common but damaging phrase}

StepHeader{Forces between}

This is a common enough phrase, used by all and sundry, including professors of physics when discussing gravity on a radio show. In fact he repeated it so often that it really got under my skin enough to consider it afresh: that's often not easy to do, with things that have become second nature (perhaps in the phrase adopted by Kahnemann, are system 1 operations). Often careful teaching requires a re-learning of a topic, or at least the empathetic effort to see it afresh from the point of view of a learner inexperienced in the domain ( in Kahnemann's terms this is someone working effortfully with system 2). So here's the phrase.

TeacherSpeak{There is a force between two objects that pulls them together.}

This is so familiar to teachers of physics that it may  be processed accurately with little hesitation—a sure sign that system one is engaged.

StepHeader{Parallel sentences}

But I think it may be misleading, and is not as helpful as we could be. So let's try a sentence with a similar structure.

TeacherSpeak{There is a axle between two wheels that holds them together.}

If you say this to a friend then ask them to draw it—you'll not be surprised to get 3 things drawn. You could try again, with separate entities.

TeacherSpeak{There is a table  between two chairs that forms a backdrop.}

Same procedure, and now you'll definitely get three objects drawn. You can perhaps see where this is going, but I don't think there's any sleight of hand or mind in the choice of examples.

So the crucial test now is to ask a friend who is not scientifically trained to draw what they think you're talking about when you utter this phrase.

TeacherSpeak{There is a force between two objects that pulls them together.}

StepHeader{Messages for practice}

There are, I think three messages for reflective practice in here.

- drawing what you think you're talking about often forces a commitment that clarifies.
- translating the phrase under investigation, by substituting the nouns helps to clarify what is being asserted
- too much familiarity may inhibit helping others learn new stuff

StepHeader{Particular suggestions}

For the particular issue of teaching about forces we might juxtapose the following two formulations, and prefer the latter.

WrongTrack{There is a force between two objects that pulls them together.}

RightLines{Each of the two objects exerts a force on the other.}


You might think that this is more technical language. Perhaps it needs to be, so that it's clear enough. Accessibility is after all, worse than useless if it necessarily misleads.

StepHeader{Draw more: write less?}

Or maybe we should, for this case, draw more, and talk less. That might be a more helpful representational strategy.

InsertGraphic{FoDrawNotWritePID}{400}{310}

In a neat twist, the drawing is, of course, made by writing – it's only code.
