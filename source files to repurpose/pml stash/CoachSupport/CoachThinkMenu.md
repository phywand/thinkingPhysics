WebTitle{Links for coaches, based on SPT topics, with developments}

Here are  tools for finding resources (preparing for sessions; constructing guides), links for specific topics, and then general advice on coaching and links to support authoring.

SafteyTip{Due to a change in role, these pages will not be actively maintained by @SPTsensei after March 29th.}


StepHeader{Coaching links by topic}

Each linked page is a jumping off point for coaching in that topic, but avoids repetition by not including the general advice and links from this page.

Some of these will contain heuristically useful insights, but the proliferation and lack of consensus might suggest that commitment to any single theory is unwise. The jury is definitely still out. Which is not to say that anything goes, or that we should ignore all research-derived insight!}
