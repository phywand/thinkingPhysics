WebTitle{Doing Physics is reasoning with representations}

Thinking, doing physics: learning physics is about reasoning and thinking like a physicist—to enable this you need to have in mind a shared ontology of objects with which to do the reasoning.


StepHeader{Preparing to teach: reasoning with representations}

So, in any topic, the following are very reasonable questions in preparing to teach the topic.

- What do you expect children to reason with?
- How will you exemplify that reasoning?
- What expectations can children generate from that reasoning?

StepHeader{Mental models and their constituents}

This is a view of an education in physics as the co-creation and elaboration  of mental models. To think with a mental model is to act on entities reified as  representations. To work with these entities you need to know the 'three Cs': constituents; capabilities; changes.

- What these entities are made of(constituents)?
- What these entities can do(capabilities)?
- What these entities  can have done to them(changes)?

You come to know the 'three Cs' through working with the representation to reason with (the model): exploring and exploiting internal and external interactions.

Physics is all about imaginative representations of the world, that exhibit functional mimicry of 'what's out there'. Real mental models, with interacting entities can be run forward in time to generate expectations. If precise enough—falsifiable as a result of an empirical observation (which includes measurements) – these expectations can form predictions.

StepHeader{Mental models and  topics}

Seven  topics for 11-14 each introduce a particular representation, with which to reason about particular facets of reality: these representations have restricted phenomenal scope. These are the topics: SPT: Electric circuits topic; SPT: Magnetism topic; SPT: Forces topic; SPT: Light topic; SPT: Machines topic;  SPT: Motion topic; SPT: Sound topic.

The SPT: Earth in space topic is rather different in that it draws on the representations established in the SPT: Forces topic , SPT: Motion topic, and SPT: Light topic topics to develop an account of what we see.

The SPT: Energy topic is again different: it develops a general mode of reasoning that can be applied to many phenomena. That's a part of what makes teaching energy hard, but you can still reason with a set of representations to develop expectations and generate predictions – although these indicate what's impossible, rather than what will happen.

StepHeader{Going further: integrating reasoning and representations}

The three further topics (SPT: Electricity and energy topic, SPT: Force and motion topic, SPT: Radiations and radiating topic) further develop the reasoning and representations, adding some new representations to encompass more of reality (adding new phenomena) and show how coherence across the topics increases.
