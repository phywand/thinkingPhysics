WebTitle{ Talking about photons and pathways}

TeacherOne{I do not get all this QuoteThis{light is a pathway and not a store} business.}

TeacherTwo{Particle physicists tell me light is energy.}

TeacherOne{I suppose, being particle physicists, they're talking about photons. If I thought about that for a bit I'd be even more confused, as I thought you could only detect photons when you destroyed them.}

TeacherTwo{I suppose so, maybe what they mean is that each time a photon is absorbed, energy increments by a small amount.}

TeacherTwo{And decrements from elsewhere.}

TeacherOne{But surely this incrementing and decrementing is happening over time: it's a process, still happening. So really we're dealing with a flow of energy, a power.}

TeacherTwo{And we need a kind of place for the incrementing and decrementing to happen. I know it's not a physical place, but spatial metaphors are so powerful.}

TeacherOne{Yes, and the accumulations are the result of the accumulating. So there's a kind of store of energy, which can be augmented, or depleted. So this is from snapshot to snapshot, from one time of the clock  to another. And then there's the flow of energy, the power.  That is happening over a duration.}

TeacherTwo{I can see that we'd not want to confuse that pair. One is a power in watts(the happening): the other is an energy in joules(what has happened).}

TeacherOne{I suppose the flow of photons are naturally a power. So it'd make more sense to think of them as augmenting or depleting stores. So warming things up. Maybe this is why light is better thought of as a pathway, connecting stores, and not a store.}

TeacherThree{I thought you were heading along the QuoteThis{right lines}. Maybe next time we can think about electrical power.}
