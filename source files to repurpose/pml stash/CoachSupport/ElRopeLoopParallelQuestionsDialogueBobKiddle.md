WebTitle{Using the rope model in parallel circuits}

TeacherOne{I tried the rope model like Bob showed us and it worked really well at first}
 
TeacherTwo{How did you get the idea of current across with it?}
 
TeacherOne{I set Mary on counting the dots on the rope and Jimmy measured one minute.}
 
TeacherTwo{Did you do that at different points on the rope?}
 
TeacherOne{Yes, I then set Pam and Archie counting dots at different points—it developed the idea of conservation of current very nicely.}
 
TeacherTwo{Did it work for parallel circuits?}
 
TeacherOne{Much less so.  I don't know how you can get the same QuoteThis{voltage} on two different ropes at the same time.}
 
TeacherOne{It'd only work if the current in both branches is the same.}

TeacherThree{I'm not so sure about that—I've heard of others doing it.}
 
TeacherTwo{So what other models would work to show that better?}
 
TeacherOne{Well there’s the walking round the room model&hellip;}
 
TeacherTwo{How does that work—is it any different sweets in the cup model or the bread van model, because I've heard that there are real difficulties with those?}

CoachComment: This might work well to open up a follow up session on electric circuits, where the rope loop model has been suggested in an earlier session.
