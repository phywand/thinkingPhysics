WebTitle{ Deciding how to draw electrical circuits}

TeacherOne{I let the kids draw the circuits how they want: it lets them show their creativity.}

 TeacherTwo{But don't you find consistency particularly valuable, when there's so much that can go wrong with their fragile understandings?}

 TeacherOne{I don't see how the drawing can help.}

 TeacherTwo{Surely you can see that there are some helpful conventions that could be adopted?}

 TeacherOne{Surely not.}

 TeacherThree{What about supporting thinking about accumulating dissipation through electrical working?}

 TeacherOne{You what!}

 TeacherTwo{Circuits are all about controlling the shifting of energy, so about current and potential difference.}

 TeacherOne{Well, I do insist on complete loops and that does help with the current.}

 TeacherTwo{I always draw the elements with potential differences across them vertically.}

 TeacherThree{SPT does that as well...}

 TeacherOne{Whatever for?}

 TeacherOne{I've never really thought about it. The text books seem to be all over the place.}

 TeacherThree{I had real difficulty getting the artist to draw what I wanted in those worksheets I got published, so that may not be the author's fault.}

TeacherOne{So, are there any good reasons for having the dissipative circuit elements vertical?}

TeacherTwo{It gives me somewhere obvious to put my Sankey arrows, for representing the electrical working.}

TeacherThree{And the potential difference is always drawn vertically, ready for the QuoteThis{hills  analogy.}

TeacherOne{Maybe I'll try it. Where can I see some examples?}

TeacherThree{Everything in SPT is drawn that way. You might start in the SPT: Electric circuits topic, and then go on to the SPT: Electricity and energy topic for post-14 work.}

TeacherTwo{I wonder if there are any alternative conventions which we could argue for?}
