WebTitle{ Teachers discuss words, not energy}

TeacherOne{I prefer QuoteThis{sources} to QuoteThis{stores}.}

TeacherTwo{I use both: QuoteThis{stores} for the pure physics; QuoteThis{sources} for the social and environmental discussions.}

TeacherOne{But it's all just physics.}

TeacherTwo{Not quite: the the social and environmental concerns are engineering, constrained by the physics.}

TeacherThree{I agree with that, but I prefer QuoteThis{resources} to QuoteThis{sources}. It's about something we choose to do, not like the source of a river, or the source of light. And for me that's constrained by having enough, or perhaps not enough resources.}
