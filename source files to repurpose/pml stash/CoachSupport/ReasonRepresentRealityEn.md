StepHeader{What the set of stores is made of: constituents}

- named stores where energy can be found

StepHeader{What the set of stores can do: capabilities}

- be more or less full

StepHeader{What the set of stores can have done to it: changes}

For any store it can

- be filled
- be emptied

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the set of stores}

- identify impossible processes

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope  for the set of stores}

- energy is trans-phenomena: it applies to all phenomena

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- conservation principles (as a special example of a constraint relationship)

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- semi-quantitative reasoning

StepHeader{Future developments for the set of stores}

- links with pathways
- full quantification of the description
