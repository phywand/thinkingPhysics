WebTitle{ Is  'illumination' a better focus than light?}

TeacherOne{I'm always flummoxed when kids ask what QuoteThis{light} is.}

TeacherThree{Researchers  spent quite a while puzzling kids by showing them sketches of situations and asking them to talk about the light. That's partly where the idea of emphasising seeing in teaching the topic came from.}

TeacherTwo{Then maybe we'd be better off not using the word QuoteThis{light} at all, other than in the title of the topic. It could be a deprecated word in our department, just like QuoteThis{electricity}.}

TeacherOne{Sounds interesting, go on ...}

TeacherTwo{Well, I suppose its all about processes, about journeys from source to detector. So, it's not a thing we're modelling, it's a process.}

TeacherOne{I wonder if there's a connection with all that stuff about processes  happening and pathways?}

TeacherThree{I should think so. The power in a pathway is can be calculated as an illumination, measured in watts. I think there were a couple of Physics Education articles, a while back.}

TeacherOne{And lighting is a very practical thing, from virtual lighting in computer-generated scenes to that lighting group you have for the school band.}

TeacherTwo{Well, I'm always interested in the power, when I buy light bulbs, so maybe there are real practical concerns we can exploit in our teaching.}
