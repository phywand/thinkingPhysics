WebTitle{Taking care with representations}

SPT makes a bit of a fuss over careful choice of representations, hoping to provide exemplification of fruitful, intelligible, and engaging ( and therefore productive) representations. Networks of representations that support reasoning which predicts essential facets of phenomena, so functional mimicry, often form the backbone of a topic.

This is the QuoteThis{three R's} of an education in physics:

- Representations
- Reasoning
- Reality

But there is no systematic pedagogic focus on elucidating, exploiting and transforming student representations to support learning. I wonder if there should be, and if so what range of meaning making resources the students ought to have to hand.

I'm not sure that the resistances and affordances of just a pencil and a blank piece of paper are optimal, or even a culturally legitimate place to start. And I worry about the teacher skill set needed to implement such a pedagogy.
