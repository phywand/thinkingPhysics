WebTitle{ On being a coach}

You will inevitably be a role mode and so it's worth remembering that exemplifying is more persuasive than just telling: the unspoken messages revealed in how you approach physics are very likely to unsettle any explicit exhortations contradicted by what you do.

## Three coaching acts

Good coaching draws on three kinds of thinking and doing, on three kinds of QuoteThis{know-how}.

ThinkHeader{Probe}

Find out what's known and what is unknown—QuoteThis{probe-how}.
Use non-threatening, but often challenging and always engaging, stimuli to explore participants understanding.

PupilSpeak{Target Outcome}{I've never really thought about it (like that/ at all/ and did not realise that…). Oh, so that's what we think.}

ThinkHeader{Show}

Enact, exemplify and so enliven a piece of teaching—QuoteThis{show-how}.

Act out a real teaching episode, wrapping it in a meta-level discussion that contextualises and enriches, but never replaces, the real action.

PupilSpeak{Target Outcome}{I can see how you develop the idea and that the approach might work for me.}

ThinkHeader{Tell}

Advise: share moderated experience and insight from research and implementations—QuoteThis{tell-how}.

PupilSpeak{Target Outcome}{I did not know about that, and can see how it connects to what I might try in my classroom}

The balance will vary to suit the occasion, but coaching necessarily involves an interplay across all three elements.

## Encouraging change

Having an impact  will mean encouraging change of practice: that teachers do different in their classrooms. And not just because you say so, but because they have internalised some facets of what you say, enabling them to intelligently interpret suggestions for their particular situation, so carrying out a QuoteThis{teaching experiment}.

To motivate these you'll want to get beyond sharing possibilities to reasoned and persuasive probabilities—to pedagogy.

There may be pain: inspecting existing representing and reasoning in teaching practice requires effortful thinking in a supportive environment.

There should be gain: you're engaged in persuasive, rhetorical communication, aiming for plausiblity, intelligibility  and fruitfulness.

## On planning and preparing

To encourage a systematic approach to CPD an adaptable sequence that respects a well-founded knowledge of teacher development trumps a more reactive approach: few groups of teachers will not benefit from work on teaching forces, electrical circuits and energy. After these are secured, there is a kitset in place to enable other topics to be tackled: without work on these as a foundation unexpected tripwires are more likely.

Really doing physics in a classroom will draw four facets:

ThinkHeader{Making physics connect}

* to children's concerns, respecting gender and ethnicity
* to the lived-in world.

ThinkHeader{Providing tools to think with}

* representing and reasoning to enable children to make predictions
* use calculation and semi-qualitative reasoning

ThinkHeader{Making explicit links}

* to children's existing ideas
* to future learning pathways
* To future possible lives
* to other topics in physics
* to other disciplines

ThinkHeader{Exploiting physical experiences}

* sensing (physicists both notice and record)
* intervening (physicists prepare situations skilfully, coaxing nature to reveal her hidden patterns in reproducible ways)

Having these in mind that teaching physics should include these four facets will allow you to give them due weight  when planning a session or sequence.

## On being part of a community of coaches
 
Coaches might expect to share their intentions for a session, by sharing both their planning and the guidance for participating teachers about how this fits into their CPD, as well as sharing activities for use in the session, and that might be useful in the classroom.

In addition you might want to share resources: teaching sequences, dialogues and discussions about situations used for elucidation , and perhaps also other media displayed during the session. It's worthwhile regarding these as auxiliary: as our main aim is the  pedagogic, it's worth remembering that its really hard work to accurately discern coaching (or teaching) intentions from a document.
