StepHeader{Teaching approaches&hellip;}

- structure such that preparation and path is foregrounded
- activate pupils, so that they are prepared

In the light of
- the PN (helpful representations of the physics)
- an understanding of the TL issues (children's ideas / teachers representations)

StepHeader{A possible graphical approach}

InsertGraphic{LearningSpacesINSC}

- ART defines the topography, constrains learning paths
	- Possible paths lead children not points which are in

- Accesible zones
	- within reach
	- teaching practice knows how to do this
	- children have to mind the resources with which to engage

- Reachable zones
	- but inadvisable
	- skilful teachers might manage it with some children
	- involves the construction of resources which are then deployed

- Tricky zones
	- just don't go there
	- not a route that's known to work
	- there are significant learning difficulties, perhaps dues to
		- the physics
		- resources that are inaccessible to the children
		- deeply embedded(hard to shift) existing children's ideas

- The task is then to pick out routes, being aware of the prior ART
- The Physics Narrative defines the topography, and so the ART zones

StepHeader{Preparation involves:}

- the teachers, who need to plan in the light of the ART, and so need
	- to know about children's ideas
	- to know about existing practice
	- have a good grasp of the Physics Narrative
- the children, who need useful resources to be primed and activated
- the physical space

StepHeader{Doing follows preparing}

- fruitfulness of doing depends on preparation and on respecting the ART zones

StepHeader{Tools to communicate the doing}

- kit lists SymbolArrowright what to prepare
- pieces of IPRPRPRE dialogue SymbolArrowright fruitful dialogue
- sharing particular barriers to learning, and how to circumvent them SymbolArrowright teaching tips
- sequences and the rationale
- priming children, techniques and prior ideas assumed
