WebTitle{Using multiple models in electric circuits}

Electric circuits are rather difficult to teach, because almost everything about them is intangible. That is not to say that the experiences that people have are intangible, but simply that the explanations we offer of how electric circuits work are entirely constructed from entities which are intangible. As a result, it's a very bad idea to use electric circuits as a place to explore the use of models in science.  What's the evidence that this is so?

Children often replace what's happening with QuoteThis{what's supposed to happen}.

Uncertainty is magnified when a model comes to dominate the phenomena its intended to represent. This resonates with experience of reasoning using representations in  phenomena across many topic areas, but there is one explicit situation worth focussing on,  in which children are clearly expressing their own views.

There is evidence from using situations where children write their own computer models that they sometimes become so comfortable with the models, or have such a commitment to the model they developed, that they will indeed reshape the phenomenon in order that it fit their model. That is, they think the model is of such validity, that their original understanding of the phenomenon now needs recasting. Such recasting then becomes very resistant to change.

I'd suggest that work with electric circuits is very likely to follow such a pattern in many classrooms, where the model does play such a prominent role that it can easily overshadow the phenomena. I'd therefore suggest comparing models in topics where the phenomena are both robustly demonstrable and robustly described.

StepHeader{Working with fragile understandings}

In many (most?) cases the child's understanding of the phenomenon is itself plastic. This can be true even where the phenomena are microscopic and biological—for example  in population dynamics. When they are working intensively with a model, they can convince themselves that reality behaves in exactly the way that their own imagined world in front of them behaves. Perhaps this is not so surprising, but it does bear careful reflection. The message seems to be that if the models are used to reason with—which is a pre-condition if they have any use at all—then the models can shape thinking about the phenomenon.  Reflecting on the evolution of the sciences themselves will render this conclusion more than a bit unsurprising.

In electric circuits, the model is pretty much all you have to shape your understanding of the phenomenon. What you see, in terms of glowing bulbs and complicated arrangements of wires and cells on the laboratory bench top, is in no way easy to interpret. That's why the choice of model is all important to enable you to get a handle on what is actually happening, and develop some expectations of what you notice in front of you. Offering multiple models does not offer such a secure scaffolding: it'll seem more of a lash-up. On what basis is the child supposed to choose which model to use when, if they remain only tentative about the phenomena (and the evidence would suggest that they do)?

StepHeader{Choosing wisely}

There are quite a few are well established ideas about electric circuits which children commonly adhere to, but which are nevertheless detrimental to the a full understanding of electric circuits. One such is that the battery is the source of charge. Another is that charge is lost on the way round the circuit—the flow before and after bulbs is not identical.

It'd really great pity to choose a teaching model which reinforced these barriers to developing a correct understanding of electric circuit.

Such a choice can be made by selecting any model which relies on things being donated to the 'charges' as they pass through the battery, and these things being passed on by the same 'charges' as the 'charges' pass through the  lamp. I do think this is a model which is clearly detrimental in the light of the best available evidence.

StepHeader{Starting elsewhere}

There are regularly claims that starting with potential difference or energy, rather than current, might  provide a better route to learning about circuits.  This is an empirical question, and so devising and testing such a route is perhaps worthwhile. It's not a question that can be settled a priori.

But investing such effort may not be wise. Here are some thoughts from McDermott, published in 1992. She had worked extensively in the area.

QuoteThis{ B. Choice of current as the basis for building model}

QuoteThis{In the model-building process that has been described, the initial model development is based on the concept of potential difference or energy are other possibilities. However these alternatives have disadvantages that we believe outweigh the benefits. Starting with potential difference introduces a need for both a "pressure" and a flow that results from that pressure. Thus very early in the development of the model, the concepts of both potential difference and current are present. It has been our experience that the concept of a flow is more intuitive to students, especially to those who are not mechanically inclined, than are ideas related to pressure. The choice of current as the initial concept permits model development to begin with a single concept. The introduction of potential difference can be delayed until students are familiar with current. Although lack of a causal agent may be disturbing to a physicist, it does not seem to be a serious problem for most students. When it becomes necessary in the development of the model, most students readily identify the battery as the agent that drives current through the circuit. Regardless of which concept forms the basis for model building, once the other is introduced, difficulty in discriminating between the two will arise and needs to be expressly addressed. Almost invariably during the process of developing a model, students will try to base their explanations on energy considerations. We have found that the introduction of the concept of energy early in the model development leads to complications. Students often fail to distinguish current from energy. When they attempt to reason on the basis of energy, they have difficulty in reconciling the dissipation of energy with the conservation of current.}
