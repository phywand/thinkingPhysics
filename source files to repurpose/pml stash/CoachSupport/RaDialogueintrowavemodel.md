WebTitle{ Talking about Models}

TeacherOne{I like to introduce the wave model very early.}

TeacherTwo{Why complicate things-surely it's best to get the phenomena straight first.}

TeacherThree{So what do you do, to introduce the wave model?}

TeacherOne{Isn't that obvious? I show them refraction and reflection of light, then the refraction and reflection with a ripple tank, then point out that they're the same thing really.}

TeacherTwo{I'd agree with showing the phenomena clearly, but just how do you establish the links?}

TeacherOne{I just tell them that they're both about waves: there's a similarity.}

TeacherThree{That doesn't seem much like making a model.}

TeacherOne{But they are similar: isn't that enough&mdash;just as model cars have much the same appearance as real cars.}

TeacherTwo{I think scientific models should show a bit more of the workings, not just the appearance.}

TeacherThree{I think that's right. Physics is not a surface subject&mdash;it's about making deep connections, so I'd expect some functional mimicry in the model.}

TeacherTwo{Yes, the children should be able to do something with anything that we're going to call a model&mdash;I mean that they should be able to manipulate the thing to make predictions. It should be a tool for thinking.}

TeacherThree{I agree. So we'd need to spell out just what we'd expect children to be able to do with the model.}
