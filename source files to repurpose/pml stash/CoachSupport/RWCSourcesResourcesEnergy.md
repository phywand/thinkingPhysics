WebTitle{Energy sources or resources â€“ energy dissipated for a purpose}

StepHeader{Helpful resonances}

We're often pushing uphill against popularisation so and everyday speech both QuoteThis{consuming} and QuoteThis{using} energy. To help us, we often move the focus from the conservation of energy as its shifted between stores to a discussion of the ways in which our needs and desires are met, and the constraints that energy considerations might place on these.

In this shift to a closer link to societal concerns QuoteThis{sources} and QuoteThis{resources} are used to supplement somewhat purist energy descriptions of the kind that we might encourage in developing a purely scientific view of processes. Newspapers report:

JustSpeak{&hellip;death is impossible as we're all just containers of energy}

SPT has gone with QuoteThis{resources} as the major thrust of episode 03 of the energy topic. These energy resources are then systematically linked back to the purist descriptions of stores, and their filling and emptying. That choice of QuoteThis{resources} was not accidental, and by looking at the connotations of the two words outside of physics-land(where most people spend most of their time), we can get some handle on why the choice might be a good one.

StepHeader{Source}

To start with physics, we already make use of the term source, as in: QuoteThis{Sources of radiation} (QuoteThis{Light source}, QuoteThis{Sound source}). This is well established, and ties in well with other self-willed entities,such as the source of a river.

The closest dictionary reports three groups of uses which are congruent with this line of thinking.

- The act of rising; a rise; an ascent.
- The rising from the ground, or beginning, of a stream of water or the like; a spring; a fountain.
- That from which anything comes forth, regarded as its cause or origin; the person from whom anything originates; first cause.


StepHeader{Resource}

Here things such as resources in project management, or the human resources department, or the mineral resources of a nation all spring to mind. All speak of purposive or deliberative use of something thought to be quantifiable by humans, which is why I think there are no well-established uses of resource in physics, because the whole point of physics is to achieve a description of interacting entities which play out their parts independently of human desires or intentions.

Again the closest dictionary reports two groups of uses which are congruent with this line of thinking.

- That to which one resorts to or on which one depends for supply or support; means of overcoming a difficulty; resort; expedient.
- Pecuniary means; funds; money, or any property that can be converted into supplies; available means or capabilities of any kind.

StepHeader{A reasoned preference}

As with many minor details, this may or may not be critical to learning: that'd be a rather difficult empirical question to answer. But it does seem that the available semiotic resources we might want to exploit lie on the side of using QuoteThis{resource}. We are after all, moving from the austere constraint reasoning about stores and pathways, which, after all, mostly predicts impossibilities, to the rather more engineering-focussed actions and intentions of humans.

TeacherTip{Use QuoteThis{energy resources} and not QuoteThis{energy sources} to reduce the chance of inserting another tripwire on the learning path.}
