WebTitle{A set of activities, or a sequence}

StepHeader{But how to choose?}

At the moment the teaching and learning threads and physics narrative provide guidance, but the  fusion needs to happen in the head of the teacher. And does it, or can we provide more support? And just maybe, is it possible to develop professional engagement through the sharing of reasons for selecting teaching sequences that transcend both the purely pragmatic and local circumstances?

Here is what we have, typically, at the moment, for the machines topic:

InsertLinkPN{Physics Narrative for Machines episode 01}{Ma01PN.html}

Which provides a version of the physics story, and therefore implies some constraints on a teaching sequence.

InsertLinkTL{Teaching and Learning Issues for Machines episode 01}{Ma01TL.html}

This identifies, and provides an exposition of, all the teaching and learning challenges faced in developing the idea, here that of levers. But possible learning sequences are not developed. The teacher is left with a series of decisions to be made, and suggestions for things to try and do and things to avoid. There are some activities, In a separate thread, but these are not ordered and not correlated to either of the first two threads, although the choice of activities is guided by the first two threads.


InsertLinkTA{Teaching Approaches for Machines episode 01}{Ma01TA.html}

Perhaps it's worth considering publishing a number of teaching sequences associated with each episode of each topic. Or perhaps even redeveloping the teaching approaches in such a way that they do form a reasoned sequence. That implies that will actually share the reasoning behind the sequencing.

Might to this lead to more engagement?

There are already idealised learning paths for the whole topic: we could use this technology to develop possible planned routes for each episode, somehow displaying the reasoning.
