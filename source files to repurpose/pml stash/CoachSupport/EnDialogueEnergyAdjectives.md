WebTitle{ Seeing a unity, not transforming individuals}

TeacherOne{I've got this question: QuoteThis{ Use kinetic energy to calculate how fast the car is travelling at the bottom of the ramp} which seems to use the QuoteThis{old language}.}

TeacherTwo{I'm not sure it's a very well worded question, but I'm equally unsure why you're so troubled by QuoteThis{kinetic energy}.}

TeacherOne{I think it's just unhelpful, leading children off down the wrong tracks. Energy is so hard&mdash;it's such a subtle idea&mdash;that we need all the help we can get.}

TeacherTwo{So just how does replacingQuoteThis{kinetic energy} with QuoteThis{energy in the kinetic store} and so on, help?}

TeacherThree{Well, the formal version is that adjectives are often used to individuate members of a class. So the saloon car is one individual and the hatchback car is another. They have some things in common(they're cars), but they are separate individuals: they're not interchangeable or transformable.}

TeacherOne{And you can point to cars, learning what the class is ostensively: you cannot do that with energy.}

TeacherTwo{Two candidates for Word of the week: ostension and individuation. Is there a simpler version?}

TeacherOne{Dragons are about as real as energy to many children, so this may help. A dragon watcher reports seeing a blue dragon and a green dragon. That clearly implies two individuals. Another spotter reports a dragon that had some blue plumage and a dragon that had some green plumage. That encourages the possibility  that we might think of two sightings of the same thing, rather than two separate things.}

TeacherTwo{So all of this concern about not using adjectives with energy is to help children see that there is only energy&mdash;it's all one, not individuals morphing or transforming: I can see how that's pretty essential to accounting for conservation and dissipation. More words communicate more clearly.}

TeacherThree{Yes, in a difficult topic we need all the marginal gains we can get. But I might tell a story about birders, not dragon spotters.}
