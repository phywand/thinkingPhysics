StepHeader{reasoning with a representation: the loop}

The main tool for reasoning is the loop, as it emphasises the systemic nature of circuits: what's in a complete loop has to be taken into account to figure out what is happening in a circuit. It makes no sense to deal with the elements in a circuit as isolated entities.

The current in the loop is set  by the  voltage (choose a battery) and the resistance (choose a bulb).


Electrical circuits may be composed of more than one loop.

StepHeader{What the loop is made of: constituents}

- wires, which simply link the other elements
- batteries or cells
- lamps or bulbs
- resistors
- switches

StepHeader{What the loop can do: capabilities}

- switch power, from one pathway to another
- shift energy, from one store to another, as  a result of the accumulated action of the power
- perform remote electrical working

StepHeader{What the loop can have done to it: changes}

- vary the number of constituents
- vary the location of constituents
- vary the value of constituents

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the loop}

- where power will be switched
- how much power will be switched

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope  for the loop}

- passive direct current circuits with series and parallel connections

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- constraint relationships
- proportionality (as a special example of a constraint relationship)

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- semi-quantitative reasoning

StepHeader{Future developments for the loop}

- active components
- ever more combinations of loops to represent and reason about more complex circuits
- alternating current
