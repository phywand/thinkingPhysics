WebTitle{Styles of reasoning with representations}


 At the moment two styles of reasoning are pre-eminent in reflecting on SPT:

- idealisation
- semi-quantitative reasoning

StepHeader{Idealisation}

The clear distinction between the physical and conceptual descriptions is central to this process. Re-describing is the key move: it eve has its own badge. 'Seeing it like this' is a key move in developing an understanding of physics: one has to re-imagine the world in a new way to learn to do physics.

The move from physical to conceptual is not the only idealisation: there are often further refinements in how the situation or process is being represented.

StepHeader{semi-quantitative reasoning}

This is baked into the SPT representations, which are expressly designed to  enable rough and ready reasoning about how much, without having to reach for a calculator or algorithm. The intention is that it lays a foundation for expecting the calculations   that follow will make sense, and that it provides a framework for thinking about which calculations to choose in each situation. It is, in fact, and introduction to think like a physicist, rather than only to learn to apply some algorithms that physicists have found useful.

StepHeader{Where next: links to A level and beyond}

These quotes from  aspirations for kinds of thinking  supported by A-Level:  it's not so clear how these can be interpreted pre-16.

StepHeader{The characteristics of physics}

These are the elements that characterise and define the disciplinary approach of physics. It is through these characteristics that the laws and models of physics have been, and continue to be, devised and how they are refined and used. They do not refer to subject content but may be exemplified with reference to such content.

**Reductionism** Physicists describe and model systems in terms of the properties of their constituent parts.

**Universality** The most powerful physical laws are universal—they are the same in different contexts and on different scales.

**Unification** There is a drive to reduce the set of laws to as small a number as possible, each one expressed in as economical a way as possible.

**Consistency** Physics is an interlinked totality of ideas which have to be consistent with each other; any apparent inconsistency drives further study.

**Synthesis** It is often necessary to bring to bear many aspects of the discipline to find a solution to a physics-based problem

**Empiricism** Physicists devise and refine explanations though the iterative sequence of analysis, model, prediction, experimental test and re-analysis.

**Mathematical formulation** Physical laws can be expressed in a mathematical form; physicists and engineers develop mathematical models to describe and predict behaviour.

**Applicability** The laws and models of physics lend themselves to being applied to understand and predict behaviour in fields other than physics and to finding solutions to engineering-based problems.

And, from the same source, this is what we hope for of the students own styles of thinking:

StepHeader{Competencies: attitudes, actions and ways of thinking}

**Seek deep understanding** look for deeper and deeper explanations and not being satisfied with superficial descriptions; seek the most fundamental answer that has predictive power across many domains;

**Use experiments and their results** refer to observations of phenomena and devise experiments to isolate or test those phenomena in controlled conditions;

**Seek consistency** test that answers are consistent with experience and all other areas of physics; approach problems from different directions to see if the results are the same;

**Think critically** puzzle away at something to find the best solutions and explanations taking account of all possible objections;

**Set aside preconceptions** step outside immediate experience and accept the consequences and implications of theories & evidence—even when they may go against perceived common sense;

**Employ methods to test plausibility of results** use approximation and order of magnitude estimations, making back-of-the-envelope calculations to test plausibility; consider limiting or extreme cases

**Use reason and logic** strive for logical consistency and well-reasoned sequences within arguments;

**Be creative** look for original, imaginative and creative solutions to existing or new problems;

**Think with & construct models to predict behaviour** develop and use models (often mathematical) of systems to make predictions of their behaviour in a variety of circumstances;

**Simplify descriptions,explanations and models** describe systems in terms of their core elements in order to produce  effective quantitative or illustrative models i.e. determining which characteristics can be ignored without losing the essence of the system;

**Use parallels & analogies** use models and formulations used in one area of physics in others;

**Apply the laws and ideas** apply and employ their knowledge of the physical world, and the way it behaves to solve problems in other fields;

**Design & make things** improve our experience of the world by innovation and design: making artefacts, devices, structures and machines that perform a useful function (better), by exploiting new materials or techniques;
