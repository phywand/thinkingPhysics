StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: the trade-off}

The main tool for reasoning is the trade-off: a linked force and distance, both of which have to be taken into account to figure out the likely effect.

This trade-off (as an input) can be linked to another trade-off (the output) to give a complete hydraulic or mechanical machine.

StepHeader{What the the trade-off is made of: constituents}

- an input force
- a distance move by the input force

or

-  an output force
- a distance move by the output force

StepHeader{What the the trade-off can do: capabilities}

- give a larger output force for a given input force
- give a larger output distance for a given input distance

StepHeader{What the trade-off can have done to it: changes}

- vary the force
- vary the distance

StepHeader{Expectations generated with linked  trade-off pairs}

- the effect of the input
- the effect on the input

- proportionality (as a special example of a constraint relationship)

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}
