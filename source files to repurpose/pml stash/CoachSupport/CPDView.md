WebTitle{ A helpful description of Physics-based CPD}

StepHeader{Teaching experiments}

In running a CPD session you are, in effect, suggesting a 'teaching experiment' to people. Some experiments are rather open, or exploratory, and others confirmatory, or closed. But in all cases there is an experimenter: the teacher whose interpretation and commitment are essential to the enactment.

StepHeader{Intervening in a process}

You, as session leader,  support the setting up and execution of  the experiment, making experimental resources available to teachers.  Your implicit  pitch is:

"Try thinking about the physics in this way, with these tools, and doing these kinds of things, for these reasons, and you'll likely be more effective".


To motivate the experiment, you'll be drawing on these facets:

- empathy with, and knowledge of, the situation of the teachers
- insights about learning
- practical and technical know-how
- subject-based insight
- connection with the community of practitioners and supporters

A session is both an intervention in professional development and  polyvalent: it has many connections to continuing thought and action by teachers, so expect to engage in many of these facets during a session as a foil for and activator of the teachers' own thinking.

The teachers own thinking is central: executing the 'teaching experiment' may seem more like  an engineering project. The session provides resources in one context that can be repurposed in another— exaptive engineering. The engineer is the teacher: you provide the materials—suggestively shaped and sequenced. The session is only a part of the thinking and adapting:  a trigger for professional development.

StepHeader{Examples of teaching experiments}

- Try a demonstration discussion using the orange fluid and labelled pots when developing energy descriptions
- Distinguish clearly between the physical and the conceptual in discussing illuminated objects: rays and beams
- Connect the applications of physics, to more gender-neutral examples (e.g. magnetism: such as catches on doors, cases and boxes, rather than scrapyards and industrial machinery.)
- Collate practical results that are expected to be convergent on large results sheets on the lab wall, to promote inter-group discussion and conflict resolution, so minimising  teacher mediation, and the 'what we should have found is' resolution.

StepHeader{Humility essential}

You cannot guarantee that the experiment will go well for the teachers, so humility is essential. If the session makes a difference, then teachers will be experimenting: you can provide resources to support such activity through exemplification and documentation.

CPD will present novel ways of thinking about the physics and new ways of doing things, so there will be a loss of 'unconscious competence'  and so confidence in transitioning to new practices.  Teachers will not automatically  maintain even normal performance during the transition: reworking practice requires effortful thinking. Transitioning to a successful new practice is a risky business depending crucially  on grit, resilience and support.

StepHeader{Three parting shots}

Above all, think of a CPD session as suggesting things worth trying ('teaching experiments'), located in the context of the teachers own development,  and remember that there are no guaranteed outcomes.
