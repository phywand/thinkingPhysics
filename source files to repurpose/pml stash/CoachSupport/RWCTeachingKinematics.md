WebTitle{Decisions in teaching kinematics}


StepHeader{Finding a good path}

SPT makes much of accumulations as an easy path to thinking about rates of change: that is true across all the topics, but finds a particular focus in kinematics, which is traditionally summarised as .

- QuoteThis{acceleration is rate of change of velocity}
- QuoteThis{velocity is rate of change of displacement}

It's not an easy area to teach, as it's all tautological, is usually started before we have access to thinking with vectors, and concerns rates of change. There are therefore some choices to be me in selecting a teaching  sequence. These are covered in the Force and motion topic, but I'm having a second go here, to see if I can convince some doubters.

StepHeader{Quotations and commentary}

TeacherSpeak{QuotationThis{acceleration changes velocity} might be better as QuotationThis{acceleration is change in velocity}.}

It might be: it'd certainly be a more traditional and familiar formulation, so there is a case to be made here, or not. SPT takes the view that it might be worth rethinking the more traditional approach, to make the path  to the final understanding more accessible for children. SPT tries to. Give access to representations and patterns of reasoning that enable children to really do predictive thinking as early on as possible.

TeacherSpeak{Now it works better to talk about the acceleration being either in the same direction or opposite to velocity.}

I don't think that this necessarily follows. Acceleration can clearly be positive or negative, so the accumulation in velocity can likewise be either positive or negative, whether the value of the velocity over that duration is positive, negative, or, indeed in transition between these values.

The choice here is whether to make rates of changes (so differentiation) on the essential learning path, or instead choose to approach acceleration through accumulations (so making integration central). As QuoteThis{rates of change} are complex (infinitesimals, chords and tangents all raise their subtle heads), a more accessible path might be wrought by building on the idea of repeated addition, or accumulation. That's really what lies at the heart of  the suggestion that we try accumulations as an approach. Here is a very simple model: interactive representations with which you can reason.

StepHeader{Number lines, or not}

TeacherSpeak{ Students will inevitably think about the number line when working in one dimension so that negative is to the left and positive to the right. An object with a negative velocity will therefore slow down when the acceleration is positive and not speed up!}

I think this is where cuisinaire rods and vectors can really help us: I'd draw some diagrams to help. The number line seems to be unhelpful here, as, I suppose we're hoping they'll not be confused by the three connected quantities that could be mapped onto the number line.

StepHeader{Rates or accumulations}

The choice is between thinking of acceleration as an placeAcumulator(admittedly a bit different) or as a rate(rather more traditional).

For either choice I think that there is a clear cut case for working with the most evocative representation, and here that is, in my opinion, not words. Here is a quote from a case for the QuoteThis{acceleration is the rate of change of velocity learning path}.

TeacherSpeak{Likewise if velocity and acceleration are both negative the object speeds up.}

I think these kinds of formulations are exactly what we want to avoid. It takes too much of my available brain power to decode to see if this is sense or no.

This is better done with diagrams, than words: words should follow diagrams, and not the other way around. Then you can exploit the  power of vector addition, even in presented in a restrictive way (we usually restrict ourselves to one dimension in getting started with kinematics).


StepHeader{Even so, choose words wisely}

Even if we must use words, let's exploit our tendency to think in terms of actors:

TeacherSpeak{acceleration changes velocity}

This is concise, and leaves no doubt as to which is actor and which acted on. It's a scenario we can play out in our minds, leading to effective mental models.
