WebTitle{Cause and relationships}

TeacherOne{My students think that voltage happens because of current and resistance.}

TeacherTwo{I found that happened when I started with the equation—now I leave it for last.}

TeacherThree{So what’s your starting point? Batteries?}

TeacherOne{Or the Van der Graff, or lemons. Anything that provides a potential difference.}

TeacherThree{How do you change the resistance?}

TeacherOne{I don’t—we just increase or decrease the potential difference, then measure the current. That’s the link I want them to get first.}

TeacherTwo{Do they use ammeters? Or do you use bulb brightness to start with?}

CoachComment: Switch to 'potential difference' rather than 'voltage'

CoachComment: Avoiding powerpacks means students have a better grasp of 'more' pd because more cells, or more lemons…

CoachComment: Focus is on more pd leading to a bigger effect

CoachComment: Science first, maths last—narrative approach
