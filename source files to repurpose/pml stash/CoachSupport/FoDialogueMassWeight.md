WebTitle{ Introducing mass â€“ it's not weight}

TeacherOne{Sheesh, I've just been doing the QuoteThis{mass is not weight} routine with my year nines. Hard going, or what?}

TeacherTwo{I always just tell them that mass is about how much stuff there is, and that weight's just the force of gravity.}

TeacherOne{I don't think our chemist colleagues would be too happy about that: they're pretty sold on the mole being the SI unit of quantity of matter.}

TeacherThree{Let's go back to that idea of weight being the supporting force, connecting it to the sensation of being supported. Then you've a path to linking weight to acceleration: it's the force that stops your mass accelerating. The bigger the mass, the bigger the force necessary.}

TeacherOne{So you build connections to the force of gravity...}

TeacherTwo{That'd link it to weightlessness neatly, and you could easily build in conversations about mass.}

TeacherThree{And so to how astronauts monitor their mass, by seeing how much their body impedes acceleration, in that special NASA-designed chair mounted between springs. I always try to explicitly include acceleration, or at least change in motion,  when exploring links between mass and force.}

TeacherTwo{Linking back to conversations we had about starting off, both up and down, in a lift.}
