WebTitle{ Clear thinking about rates, power and energy}

TeacherTwo{ You look a bit worn.}

TeacherOne{ I've just been doing some inservice with our network  and many of our physics teachers say QuoteThis{energy is basically the same as power isnâ€™t it...except power is per second}.}

TeacherTwo{ I hope you set them right.}

TeacherOne{I'm not sure why they would want to conflate the two:  none of them wanted to say that where you were was the same as how fast you were going, but did accept that this  was also a QuoteThis{per second} difference.}

TeacherTwo{Did you also talk about current / charge, acceleration / velocity, activity/ number, and force/ impulse?  Those are also linked by accumulations.}

TeacherOne{I'm aware of the SPT tool QWA, and the underlying unifying idea of accumulations, but I didn't think those pairs would be as helpful.}

TeacherThree{Did you get to the bottom of why they wanted to assert that power was the same as energy? Could they not see that the two ideas perform very different  roles?}

TeacherOne{I'm not sure they wanted to think about it much: just to cut to a simple story.}

TeacherTwo{Sounds like you've got to polish up your stories and make them more convincing: hard work for a hard sell. Has to be worth it though&mdash;we're being told about incipient power crises in the UK, with brown-outs suggested as a possibility if we have a hard winter.}
