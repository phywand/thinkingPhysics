StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: the isolated object}

The main tool for reasoning is the object isolated from its environment, so a free-body diagram: what's in a complete the isolated object has to be taken into account to figure out what is happening. The resultant force, mass and acceleration in the isolated object are constrained. Always deal with only a single isolated object at a time. Linked pairs of objects come later.

StepHeader{What the the isolated object is made of: constituents}

- a mass
-  contributing forces acting on the mass, identified by noticing interactions of the object with its environment
- a calculated resultant force

Here are the forces, identified by interactions.

StepHeader{What the the isolated object can do: capabilities}

- accelerate in response to the resultant force

StepHeader{What the isolated object can have done to it: changes}

- vary the number of contributing forces
- vary the value of the contributing forces
- vary the kinds of the contributing forces
- vary the value of the mass

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the isolated object}

- changes in motion as accelerations

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope  for the isolated object}

- the motion of any mass

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- constraint relationships
-   proportionality (as a special example of a constraint relationship)

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- Semi-quantitative reasoning

StepHeader{Future developments for the isolated object}

- formal calculations relating force, mass and acceleration
- linked via Newton's third law to another isolated object
