WebTitle{ Making sense from the start â€“ no fractional truths}

TeacherOne{I'm not at all happy with the imprecision of language when I introduce speed, velocity and acceleration.}

TeacherTwo{What do you mean? It all seems simple enough to me. There is a bit of maths, but it's all straightforward, even if the pupils find the manipulating and calculations hard.}

TeacherOne{I find I keep on telling them half-truths, or even things that are not true at all.}

TeacherThree{Can you give us an example?}

TeacherOne{Well, I tell them acceleration is change of speed every second, and it's just not, is it?}

TeacherTwo{Maybe it's just the best we can do, after all we don't want to confuse them with velocity, do we?}

TeacherThree{I think that there might be a better way. I'd suggest that we start with acceleration, since we've already taught a lot about force, and accelerations are something we experience, so there is an intuition to build on. Then make the connections to velocity. Then make the connections to displacement. Maybe we could even use arrows to represent these quantities from the beginning?}

TeacherTwo{That sound as though it might be interesting&hellip;}

TeacherOne{I bet it's in the SPT: Force and motion topic.}

TeacherThree{Indeed so.}
