WebTitle{Teaching Newton 3}


Newton's third law is a constraint law: there is no temporal sequence involved. So it's best to avoid any constructions that suggest first one thing then another, including that rather hallowed formulation, QuoteThis{action = -reaction}.

In representing it, I'd choose to make diagrams the primary communicating tool, maybe even interactive diagrams, like the one here (drag up or down on either arrow to set the magnitude of that member of the Newton-three pair).

In thinking about how best to teach it, I think the first stage is to consider what work you want the relationship to do: how do you expect students to reason with it? Since introducing the idea has long been thought rather difficult, I'd suggest that this is perhaps the most important stage.

Then the next stage in planning to teach it is to work out stages to that goal, each one of which has some payback.

There's some well founded practice that suggests that both careful colouring (as in the diagram above) and the use of interaction diagrams can be effective in helping.
