WebTitle{ Careless Talk costs Understanding}


TeacherOne{I'm just going to set up the ray boxes for my class...}

TeacherThree{Haven't you seen all those images from ray streaks apparatus, showing the wiggly shadows&mdash;they're all over the research literature at the moment? Perhaps we should stop calling them 'ray boxes'.}

TeacherTwo{Does that matter? It shows what we want.}

TeacherThree{Don't you clearly distinguish between rays as theoretical constructs and beams as what you might see in the lived-in world?}

TeacherOne{No time for that&mdash;they just need to be able to draw the diagrams.}

TeacherTwo{I wonder what they make of those diagrams?}
