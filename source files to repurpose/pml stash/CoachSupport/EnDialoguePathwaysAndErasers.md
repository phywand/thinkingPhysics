WebTitle{ A moderate, reasoned, selection of pathways}

TeacherOne{I know we have a restricted set of stores, and that we need to have reasons for each one we use. But I'm never sure about these pathways: them seem to just plug the gaps made by the rethinking we've done about types, like light and sound.}

TeacherTwo{It took quite a bit of thinking to settle on the stores, and get our heads around them: I suspect it'll be just as hard to get pathways sorted.}

TeacherThree{Well, it's a sunny day, but the school heating's still on, so the physical world will be a good place to start. We'll try and warm your hands in different ways: shifting energy to the thermal store. Ready?}

TeacherOne{I guess so.}

TeacherThree{Start by rubbing your hands together&mdash;that's force doing some regular working&mdash;with a bit of help from (relative) velocity. You could do one long drag, or rhythmic rubbing&mdash;there's no essential difference. I suggest we call that way of warming your hands mechanical (for the forces and velocities) working (largely for historical reasons).}

TeacherTwo{As it could be rhythmic, could mechanical waves also do the pushing and pulling, instead of your muscles?}

TeacherThree{I think that'd be a helpful connection to make: it's still large scale regular movements. And if you wanted to shove electrical charges about, instead of masses, you'd be looking for electrical forces to do electrical working. That could be used to fill a store.}

TeacherTwo{Hang on, that seems a bit far-fetched.}

TeacherOne{Not so far-fetched&mdash;how about those electrically heated gloves that you took skiing last year?}

TeacherThree{OK, now for a fresh start. Hold your hands in the sunshine. They're warming up again: the thermal store is filling. But there is no regular pushing and pulling going on.}

TeacherOne{So just how is the thermal store being filled?}

TeacherThree{Well, there are a stream of photons being absorbed. That's a much less ordered and more statistical process. So it'd be good to give it a different name&mdash;not working but heating. And this kind is heating by radiation.}

TeacherTwo{Well I can guess what the school heating is for now. I'll just put my hands on the pipes, and then will have heating by particles, won't  we? That's also disordered and statistical.}

TeacherOne{That's rather neat: but I'll have to think about that quite a lot. I wonder if we're missing any, or if it is just this pair of pairs?}

TeacherThree{You'll have to remember Occam's eraser&mdash;don't add any unless you need them to build a good description. And that means one where, in the end. you'll do power calculations for filling stores by accumulations.}
