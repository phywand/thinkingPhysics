WebTitle{ Energy stores for describing gait}

TeacherTwo{A teacher at my inset suggested we might talk about an elastic store filling during exercise as ligaments, tendons and muscles get stretched. This is biology, so I am completely out of my depth but suspect she is probably right.}

TeacherOne{Isn't there that advert about running shoes QuoteThis{returning energy}.}

TeacherTwo{Muscles are pretty complicated: I'm not sure we'd be wise to model them as springs, as their activation depends on the depletion of a chemical store.}

TeacherOne{But maybe we could model the whole ligaments-tendons-muscles system. Although we'd need to describe the physical process rather carefully: it does sound as if you'd need to get the teacher to rather carefully describe the start and end points for the analysis.}

TeacherThree{I remember this study on kangaroos that might help&mdash;here's an extract from my phone&mdash; QuoteThis{The length of the muscles doesn't change much &hellip;though the tendons, that can be 200 mm long in a large kangaroo, are stretched by 11 mm. As the tendons shorten in the next jump, the elastic energy stored in the stretched tendons is released rapidly.}}

TeacherTwo{I remember some jumping insects rely on releasing energy from an elastic store. Tendons sound simple enough for a physicist: I'm thinking of the calculations already&mdash;I wonder if tendons follow Hooke's law?}

TeacherOne{That sounds as if its a process where thinking about energy shifted from the elastic store could help explain how they can jump so far.}

TeacherThree{So I expect we could make a useful description of gait involving energy in the elastic store if only we chose good snapshots of the motion, and making clear choices in bounding seems easier&mdash;biomechanics is notoriously complicated.}
