WebTitle{Preparing a coaching session}


There are many building blocks to select from in preparing for  a session, and its far from obvious what might work well for your particular participants.

Many of these blocks will be activities that could also be used in classrooms  (showing teaching in action), but the treatment will be different. In particular, you'll want to periodically step back from exemplifying good practice to reflect on the practice, to draw out the principles that will allow participants to continue to develop by applying those principles after the session.

There will be building blocks to be used for telling: you're communicating advice and pointing people towards resources and approaches. In many cases  time will be so constrained that these are best shared outside the session, as a guide for further professional development.

But crucially, you'll also need to find out what teachers think—that is you'll need blocks suitable for probing—this elucidation is central to coaching. The whole session needs a balance adapted to the participants across the three processes of probing, showing and telling: probing guides the balancing. You have to be prepared to be shocked (and not show it) by things you assumed they'd know, but don't, and yet never fail to treat them as competent graduates. This amalgam of probing, showing and telling is to encourage teachers to develop their practice, so to teaching experiments. So you need both quick wins, and to aim for long-term change.

Naturally there are elements of encouraging the doing of physics in classrooms (making physics connect, providing tools to think with,  making explicit links, exploiting physical experiences) that'll act as selection criteria for the blocks and what you choose to do with them.

As coaching is to enable *continuing* professional development, you'll want to point people to how they can develop beyond the limits of the  session, so provide them with a guide to the session. This might usefully include:
- links or references for the building blocks that you have used in the session
* suggestions for incremental teaching approaches to try in their classrooms
* pointers to coherent study materials
* an encouragement to reflective engagement with the session
