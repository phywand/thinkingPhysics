StepHeader{Reasoning with a representation: the source-medium-detector set}

The main tool for reasoning is the source-medium-detector set, as it emphasises that the travelling vibrations link source and detector.

StepHeader{What the set is made of: constituents}

- vibrations in a source
- travelling density vibrations
- vibrations in a detector

InsertGraphic{RRRSoTravellingVibrationsPID}{600}{410}

StepHeader{What the set can do: capabilities}

- switch power, or shift energy (accumulated power): remote warming by mechanical working
- control the transmission of signals

StepHeader{What the set can have done to it: changes}

- vary the medium
- vary the location and separation of source and detector
- vary the amplitude of the source
- vary the frequency of the source

StepHeader{Expectations generated with the source-medium-detector set}

- where power will be switched
- how much power will be switched

StepHeader{Phenomena-specific scope for the source-medium-detector set}

- hearing
- reflection of sound
- attenuation of sound

StepHeader{Patterns of thinking employed}

- no common patterns

StepHeader{Styles of thinking developed}

- idealisation
- semi-quantitative reasoning

StepHeader{Future developments for the source-medium-detector set}

- multiple sources and contributions
