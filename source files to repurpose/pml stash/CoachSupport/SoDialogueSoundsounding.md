WebTitle{ Is 'hearing' a better focus than sound?}

TeacherOne{I'm always a bit careful when kids ask what QuoteThis{sound} is.}

TeacherThree{Researchers spent quite a while puzzling kids by showing them sketches of situations and asking them to talk about the sound. That's partly where the idea of emphasising hearing in teaching the topic came from.}

TeacherTwo{Then maybe we'd be better off not using the word QuoteThis{sound} at all, other than in the title of the topic. It could be a deprecated word in our department, just like QuoteThis{electricity}.}

TeacherOne{QuoteThis{Sounds} interesting, go on ...}

TeacherTwo{Well, I suppose its all about processes, about journeys from source to detector. So, it's not a thing we're modelling, it's a process.}

TeacherOne{I wonder if there's a connection with all that stuff about processes happening and pathways?}

TeacherThree{I should think so. Amplifiers and loudspeakers are all about power in a pathway,  measured in watts. I think there were a couple of Physics Education articles, a while back.}

TeacherTwo{And hearing sometime is absolutely, essentially, something that happens over a duration. That's why frequency is so natural and fundamental, rather than wavelength.}

TeacherOne{And making something audible is a very practical thing: perhaps you should rename that technical theatre club the QuoteThis{sounding} group.}
