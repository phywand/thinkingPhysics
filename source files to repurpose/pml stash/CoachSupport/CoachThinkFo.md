StepHeader{Written summary for Forces}

To describe the world with forces is to produce a powerful representation of the world: very good for particular uses. The representation is useful if you set it up carefully: otherwise not. It is useful to predict changes in motion—that is accelerations. Accelerations are always for particular objects, so forces are always acting on particular objects.

The first step in generating a description with forces is to identify and isolate the object from its environment: the surroundings. The focus is always interested in the forces acting on one object. In isolating the object you replace each kind of interaction with the surrounding objects by a single arrow, showing the direction and magnitude of the force as a result of all of the interactions of this kind.

Fortunately there are only a few kinds of interaction, so it is not too hard to identify the forces. There are contact and non-contact forces, representing interactions with local and non-local parts of the environment.

Three kinds of contact force support:buoyancy, tension and compression(both warp forces. Three more kinds of contact forces are frictional that impede motion: grip, slip and drag.

Three forces acting without contact: gravity, electric, magnetic.

With practice you can identify these forces, learning what to look for in a situation that makes it appropriate to replace a part of the environment of an object by a single labelled arrow.

The end result is a single object with arrows drawn from the object to represent all of the forces acting on the object.

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
