WebTitle{ Notes for coaches}

As role model exemplifying beats telling. How you approach physics is very likely what will be acted on.

Assay the contact time spent on each of probing, showing and telling.

Probing: exploring teacher knowledge.

Showing: enact and exemplify a piece of teaching.

Telling: share moderated experience/insight from research and implementations.

You are encouraging reasoned change, so share the reasoning.

Aim for teaching approaches that encourage representing and reasoning that is plausible, intelligible  and fruitful in the mind of the  students.

Being prepared has been found to be more effective than just having planned.

Weight your representation of physics across four facets:

Making physics connect

* to children's concerns, respecting gender and ethnicity
* to the lived-in world.

Providing tools to think with

* representing and reasoning to enable children to make predictions
* use calculation and semi-qualitative reasoning

Making explicit links

* to children's existing ideas
* to future learning pathways
* To future possible lives
* to other topics in physics
* to other disciplines

Exploiting physical experiences

* sensing (physicists both notice and record)
* intervening (physicists prepare situations skilfully, coaxing nature to reveal her hidden patterns in reproducible ways)
