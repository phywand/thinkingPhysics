WebTitle{Actionable knowledge about ideas children have}

JustSpeak{Collecting and sharing list of misconceptions is about as useful as re-writing housework lists.}

Writing the list does not get the housework done, and does not even tell you how to get started in getting the housework done: it’s more about rearranging the furniture.

Equally useless is to share categorisations of misconceptions unless these do real work for the classroom teacher. A common foible is to list a whole series of kinds of misconceptions and then point out that only one category is relevant to teaching physics. Always bear in mind the use to which knowledge might be put: teachers are participants / actors in their classrooms and the acquisition of observer’s knowledge, whilst in other ways deeply fascinating, is hard to justify as a facet of CPD.

ThinkHeader{Force and motion}

One area where there is reason to believe that children will have persistent misconceptions which are related to their lived-in world experience is in force and motion. In this area they have many years of accumulated experience that suggest Aristotelian physics is a reasonable way to generate predictions about their world and consequently Newtonian physics is an alien  artefact that requires serious, hard, and effortful reimagining of the world. Unless you can persuade teachers (and so, indirectly, their children) that these reimaginings bring benefits, you can see why they might restrict their efforts.

ThinkHeader{Electric circuits}

In the case of electric circuits I’m afraid that the problem lies mostly with a model of reasoning which is perceived to be successful by teachers but bears is little relationship to what is happening physically and therefore comes unstuck later on, perhaps after supporting some examination success. There appears little in children’s everyday experience to support one or another ways of reasoning about electric circuits. So here the challenge is to present a way of reasoning and representing about circuits that are productive, fruitful and helpful. And acceptable to teachers.

ThinkHeader{Energy}

In the case of energy the issue is more that there is no QuoteThis{traditional} successful model of reasoning, and that therefore the teaching of energy has been in many cases reduced to a simple word game, and so not about physics at all. This apparently successful practice also presents difficulties in terms of persuading teachers of the utility of a new approach.

StepHeader{Stuff you can work with}

Its for these kinds of reasons that SPT does not give lists of misconceptions, instead reworking them into classroom-useful tools for teachers to think with:

WrongTrack{Trade in QuoteThis{spectator knowledge}.}

RightLines{Always aim for  need QuoteThis{doers} knowledge, but emphasise that this is not just implicit.}

TeacherTip{Always have to the fore:QuotationThis{How will teacher’s act on what I am working with?}}
