WebTitle{When, and how, to introduce waves}

The idea of a wave is often used rather uncritically in discussing what to teach. SPT is written as if it's worth taking more care in how we sequence the idea. A wave, given the sophistication of the idea that we require for it to any useful work in reasoning about phenomena, say in sound and light, is not an intuitive, simple and accessible building block. Rather it's a sophisticated arrangement of different ideas, welded together in an encapsulated whole. And to understand the whole, we need to see what it can do, what it can have done to it, and what it's made of.

It is of course possible to simply declare that sound and light are waves, and then move on. But that rather defeats the idea that physics is an encouraging and  worthwhile pursuit, with creative thinking, iterative reasoning about and making representations of the lived-in world, in order to predict and understand. In fact I think the strongest argument against premature ideas of the wave idea is that it tends to undermine the belief that physics is fruitful, intelligible and plausible, and therefore a part of the cultural entitlement that makes up compulsory education. The professional aim should be greater that to get children to parrot the statements in the curriculum. If you're in agreement, then we'd expect children to be able to reason fruitfully with the idea of a wave.

But perhaps I'm wrong, and the idea of a wave is simple. The current English national curriculum starts by considering QuoteThis{undulations} in water waves. So let's start by considering what the idea of a wave is made of.

Imagine a surfer in the water, sitting beyond the break line, experiencing these 'undulations'. Another surfer, even further from the shore wants to communicate what's on the way. What must be communicated? (Internet surf forecasts of course do some of this). Alternatively, if you want to take the anthropomorphic element out, write some computational code, or pseudo -code, that mimics the situation.  Or any other activity that makes you re-think the situation from outside the normal paradigm of the conventional development of physics. What parameters do you need(even supposing you allow yourself trigonometric functions as a shortcut, promising to eliminate those later in the interests of keeping it really simple)?

After such an exercise—and not just reading on—I think you might find that the essential information that the surfer closer to shore wanted was the amplitude, the frequency and the delay before that reported QuoteThis{undulation} set arrived.

So, what is a wave? It must involve at least these three parameters, and combined in some way. Notice that we've not yet specified that the parameters have to be quantitative. You can easily imagine some very demotic, but effective, descriptions passing between the surfers.

Even then, there is the theoretical work we'd like the idea of the wave to do in explaining and predicting. Just what can the idea have done to it, and how can it, in turn, effect changes in other ideas. Eventually we'd like to show a unification of description, an economy of ideas underpinning a wide range of phenomena. That'll involve multi-step arguments, and extensive re-imaging of the world, to see phenomena through the idea of a wave.

And still we've not required the travelling wave equation. Yet without some appropriate translation of the connection between the amplitude and frequency  of the vibration here and now, and the nature of the future vibration over there, the wave idea is just too vague to support much reasoning. The representations we choose really do affect the kinds of reasoning that we expect children to do. Some idea of delayed mimicry seems unavoidable.

And that's without linking this description to one of remotely  filling and emptying stores of energy, either by the heating by radiation pathway, or by the mechanical working pathway. Or making connections with ray models, used to make predictions of phenomena of illumination, but not in thinking about what can be heard.

To enable an open, engaged classroom we'll need to chart a possible path through these decisions. And settle amongst ourselves why we think that the paths we choose are most helpful in getting children engaged in the pursuit of physics.
