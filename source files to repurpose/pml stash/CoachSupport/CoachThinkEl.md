StepHeader{Written summary for Electric circuits}

Electric circuits are omnipresent because they are a very convenient and controllable way of shifting energy from one place to another. So an important distinction is between something that flows around the circuit, being conserved(the electric charge) and something that is shifted, whilst still being conserved (energy is shifted from a store associated with one place to a store associated with another).

In a simple circuit of a bulb and battery, the charge, which is already present all around the circuit, is set in motion by the battery. Where the resistance is greatest, in the filament of the bulb, there the flow of charge does most working, warming the filament, which warms the surroundings by convection and radiation. Energy is shifted from the chemical store of the battery to the thermal store of the surroundings. This continues until the chemical store is depleted and the battery is “flat”. Then charge is no longer set in motion.

Adding another battery with series connection doubles the electrical forces acting on the charges, resulting in a greater steady flow, and more working in the filament.

So energy is shifted more rapidly. Adding another bulb with series connections increases the resistance, reducing the flow, resulting in energy being shifted more slowly. Adding a bulb with parallel connections to a circuit with one bulb and one battery results in two loops operating independently. In each there is the same push and pull on the charges and the same resistance as in the original circuit. So the bulb in each loop glows as one bulb by itself. But you don’t get something for nothing, the chemical store of the battery is emptied twice as quickly.

All of this semi-quantitative reasoning can be formalised, yielding some very densely interconnected relationships, so that the quantity of energy shifted each second (the power) can be worked out, given the circuit.

The core relationships are (FractionABC{power}{energy}{time}, ProductABC{energy}{charge}{voltage}, ProductABC{charge}{current}{time}, FractionABC{current}{voltage}{resistance}).

To use these relationships successfully you must have a very clear idea of the underlying reasoning, and be very careful about the quantities which you are representing by the terms in the relationships.

StepHeader{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}


Teachers will need advice beyond the session, and you could share these URLs with them. There are included here so you can bear them in mind when thinking of your own plan, and of the guidance that you might offer.

Children should be working towards a coherent and usable mental model, which they can use to describe and predict, with increasing confidence. You can check children are on their way, like this.
