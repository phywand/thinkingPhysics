TeacherOne{Of course, we all use the money analogy for energy don't we?}

TeacherTwo{But are there good reasons for that? Feynman does not use it!}

TeacherTwo{Nor does SPT&hellip; and I don't suppose that was an accident.}


TeacherOne{Well, I use it, and I'm sure other coaches do as well.}

One of the difficulties of teaching about energy is that it is abstract and intangible. So the teaching analogy chosen should provide maximal support for reasoning effectively about energy.

That is:

- There should be as much formal mapping between the source and target domains as possible
- There should be as few arbitrary rules as possible.

SPT seeks to exploit the properties of fluids, as these  are tangible, concrete and manipulable to elucidate the properties of energy. Since there is a good formal mapping between the properties of fluids and the properties of energy, there is little need for the injection of arbitrary rules and reasoning in the source domain of fluids naturally supports reasoning in the target domain of energy.  The The reasons for this are spelt out in the teaching and learning issues strand.

The importance of choosing an effective teaching analogy is not unique to energy. It appears, for instance, also in the teaching of electric circuits, which have much the same representational issues of intangibility and abstractness. Here for a long time donation models were prevalent, with many seemingly not recognising that they reinforced common unhelpful ideas that children have and require a series of arbitrary rules to operate, which do not emerge naturally from the resources to hand afforded by the analogy. In other words the analogy only works if you tweak the rules to suit the physics. That makes the physics seem just something to be learnt, rather than reasoned about, and I think this is at best an unfortunate view of physics.
