StepHeader{Develop purposeful descriptions, to support particular reasoning}


Is it possible to move from this situation to that situation? Use energy.

‘My speedometer will read less than 15 mph after I've  freewheeled down this hill’

Energy restricts what is possible: it is perhaps the ultimate limiting factor. Use an energy description to see if one snapshot can follow another.

‘If I burn all this wood, will my kettle boil?’


What's happening now? Use power.

‘The torch is glowing’

Power characterises processes whilst they are happening.

‘I am being warmed by the Sun.’

ThinkHeader{Link these two by a third}

How is this store being filled? Link power and energy after developing separate descriptions.
‘This store being filled by xxx pathway’

The two descriptions can be linked, but only after they are both developed. Power in pathways accumulates energy in stores.
‘The temperature of the pond increases in the sunshine’.

StepHeader{Three linked kinds of description, to keep separate}

Qualitative descriptions are a first act of noticing. For stores you're paying attention to some physical changes which suggest that you'll be able to calculate a change in energy, for pathways some physical changes which suggest that you'll be able to calculate a power.

Semi-quantitative descriptions emphasise that values are essential to the account, but can be deployed even when you cannot calculate (so estimate).

Fully qualitative descriptions rely on calculated energies and powers. Here the promissory notes in the first two kinds of descriptions are made good.

StepHeader{Choosing examples}

Choose examples to support the development of the ideas. It's possible that the selection of examples in the past may contribute to going down the wrong tracks. Transitions from one snapshot to another are not always best explored by developing an energy description (When fully quantified, what insights will doing the calculations reveal?). In particular, processes require the idea of power (If it's happening, use power: if it has happened, or might happen, use energy).
Beware particularly of dynamic equilibrium, paying attention to what actually changes, and what does not.

Aim to maintain a planned coherence across all three kinds of descriptions. If you cannot, then there is a high chance of misrepresenting the physics, and of laying tripwires on the path to understanding. In particular, it is possible to demand and even generate qualitative descriptions that are essentially useless.


StepHeader{The physics}

Energy is a calculated state quantity. So it is only correctly defined in a situation for a snapshot.
Energy can be shifted but is both conserved and dissipated.

Power is an interaction quantity. So it is only correctly defined for a process. Through the process power can be switched, and perhaps dissipated.

StepHeader{A checklist, learning from our wrong tracks}

- Don't write or draw in a way that supports the caloric theory of heat
- In constructing convergent activities or questions, ensure that the characterisation of the snapshot or process is not ambiguous
- Don't ask for explanations of why something does happen drawing on the idea of energy: energy is not a cause, although it may restrict
- Use careful and purposeful descriptions, whether written, calculated or drawn
- Look for mechanism elsewhere – not in accounts based on power, and certainly not in accounts based on energy
