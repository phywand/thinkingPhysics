WebTitle{ Are seasonal changes determined by differential absorption by the atmosphere?}

TeacherOne{When the angle of the sun is lower, there is more atmosphere to go through, so more of the Sun's rays are absorbed. That's why its cooler in winter.}

TeacherTwo{I think you're confusing time of day with time of year, here.}

TeacherOne{But more thickness does lead to less illumination at the surface, right?}

TeacherTwo{I'm not sure where to start}
