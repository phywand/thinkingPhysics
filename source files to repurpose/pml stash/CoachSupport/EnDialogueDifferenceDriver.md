WebTitle{ Differences drive changes}

TeacherTwo{ This new national curriculum really is the limit. What on earth does this mean &mdash;QuoteThis{that differences, for example between pressures or temperatures or electrical potentials, are the drivers of change}&mdash;it's supposed to be a key idea.}

TeacherOne{I have no idea how to teach all that, but I do remember an QuoteThis{Energy and change} project published by the ASE last century. I expect it's got something to do with that.}

TeacherThree{I think you'll need to think rather carefully about what that phrase QuoteThis{drivers of change} really means. I notice it does not say QuoteThis{causes change}.}

TeacherOne{That's a relief: I continue to be careful not to imply that differences in energy causes change. It'd be a pity to undermine that rather clear idea.}

TeacherThree{Yes, driver cannot mean predictor: pressures and temperatures are intensive quantities, like concentration, and statistical reasoning suggests that such differences will even out, where there are no barriers to them doing so. However it's not so clear that such reasoning can apply to potential differences, whether gravitational or electrical.}

TeacherOne{But that's QuoteThis{second law} thinking, and we are struggling to teach QuoteThis{first law} thinking well.}

TeacherTwo{Well it seems that there's not a general mental model that can be used, for example across electrical circuits and warm and cold fluids on thermal contact, so maybe it's best to mention it as an interesting idea, that might be followed up later, but not to make it a central part of our teaching.}

TeacherThree{I think that's wise: SPT has a central representation to reason with in every single topic, and it seems like this thought is not yet elaborated enough to take up that role.}

TeacherTwo{I can see all this statistical thinking is an important idea, but I don't think we've worked out how to teach it before A-level. I can still remember the first time I tried unit 9 of Nuffield A level.}

TeacherThree{Exacto.}
