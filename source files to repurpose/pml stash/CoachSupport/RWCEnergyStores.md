WebTitle{Reasoning about stores—reasoning with stores}

StepHeader{Energy in stores}

Energy is always found in stores. Why so? Because if it's not stored, then it is not.  For energy, to be is to be found in a store. Stores are a qualitative , and perhaps semi-quantitative description, that's a placeholder for the calculations that will follow later on in the study of energy.  So the statement that energy is always found in a store is equivalent to saying that energy is always and only a calculated quantity.

Eight stores seems plenty to reason with, enabling faithful descriptions of useful calculations that might really be done. You could argue for more stores, or fewer stores, but this might lead to descriptions that are too fine-grained, or too coarse-grained to be recognisable once the calculations start. It's a matter of judgement as to what's needed to support fruitful reasoning with these representations—that is children's reasoning.

Drag left or right to see the full range of stores,  both fuller or emptier (so semi-quantitative).

StepHeader{All about tenses}

Calculating how much energy is in a store can only be done for a particular situation: actually even that is insufficiently restrictive—you can only calculate the change in the energy in a store after selecting a pair of situations. So the calculation depends on selecting snapshots.

You can set off along the right lines by using appropriate tenses:

- What's happened / what could happen
- Stores were filled / will be filled
- Stores were emptied  / will be emptied
- Energy changes were calculated between the two situations.

StepHeader{Moving to qualitative reasoning}

You can move from the qualitative description to a fully description by replacing the  word descriptions or pictures of fuller or emptier stores with bars representing the energy in the store:

Change of state:  This would naturally be classed as a change in energy stored internally, for which the closest match is a  thermal store. (The QuoteThis{internal store} did not make an appearance as it was considered not a very evocative term, and QuoteThis{thermal store} was preferred. At the moment the field guide to the thermal store emphasises change in temperature and increased movement of the particles as the key features to look out for.

Given the similarity of the calculations done and the close associates between SHC and SLHF or SHLV, I'd suggest that the most fruitful move would be to associate the thermal store with changes state as well.  That gives a qualitative description which it will not be too hard to map onto the quantitative description when the time comes.

Why would you use  QuoteThis{work} as a synonym for QuoteThis{energy} when you don't have to, at least until specifications require it? That leaves QuoteThis{working} as a useful term to describe pathways.

Why would you insist on gravitational potential energy, or elastic potential energy, when energy is intrinsically potential: that is stored? (Yes, later there may be a case for the grouping of all stores into kinetic or potential: at about the time that you teach about Lagrangians seems about right, as then the grouping can serve some purpose.)

Why would you use QuoteThis{heating up} instead of warming, for an increase of temperature? That leaves QuoteThis{heating} as a useful term to describe pathways. It also neatly sidesteps the thermodynamic quantity QuoteThis{heat}, which can be reserved for  later, like QuoteThis{work}. (So you could fill a thermal store by mechanical working, warming something up—adiabatic compression—without having to introduce heating in either sense.)

StepHeader{Making your life in teaching harder}

Choosing examples which are about power, so flows of energy, before introducing the idea of pathways. In every other area of sciences you choose your examples in carefully ordered sequence to support the development the ideas, so why not here? Adjusting teaching to improve a particular sequence is often a matter selecting and exploiting better examples.

Choosing examples where no-one would ever really do the calculation (remember that these descriptions  are stepping-stones to a full quantitative  description to follow, not a bridge to nowhere). You do not have to describe every possible invented situation, only those which have use – physics is a purposeful activity carried out by humans.
