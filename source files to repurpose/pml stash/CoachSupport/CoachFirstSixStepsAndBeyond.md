WebTitle{The first six steps in becoming a coach, and beyond}


This list of steps provide a reasonable starting progression for considering making the transition from a successful teacher to a successful coach. This is obviously not a mechanical process and the thinking and reflective writing that you do around these steps will contribute to the development and also serve as feedstock for an application for CPhys, which is an ambition of the IOP for all coaches. The first three steps are probably best done in that order, but opportunities may have to be taken as and when they arise.

StepHeader{Step One – Orientation}

&#x2705; **On-line personal study**

- Familiarise yourself with the CPD and coaching documents.

&#x2705; **Interacting, face to face or on-line**

- Observe an IOP coaching session (summer school, regional teacher day, bespoke session in school, link/lead school session etc.)
- Use the coaching group to link up, if you are having difficulty locating a session

&#x2705; **Thinking and reflective writing**

- How is what you see different from (a) teaching (b) other CPD you have been involved with?
- How is the attention focussed across probing, showing and telling?
- Are the four facets visible (Making physics connect/ Providing tools to think with/ Making explicit links/ Exploiting physical experiences)?
- How is the QuoteThis{continuing} in CPD enabled?

StepHeader{Step Two – A start on PCK preparation}

&#x2705; **On-line personal study**

- Read Coaching in the Electric circuits topic down as far as QuoteThis{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}.

- Read Coaching in the Forces topic down as far as QuoteThis{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}.

- Read Coaching in the Energy topic down as far as QuoteThis{Advice for teachers, to bear in mind}.

&#x2705; **Interacting, face to face or on-line**

- Prepare some questions to discuss with your experienced coach buddy about the approaches and discuss them.

&#x2705; **Thinking and reflective writing**

- How does this approach relate to what you are comfortable with?
- What will you particularly need to familiarise yourself with, and maybe practice, before working with teachers?


StepHeader{Step Three – A tried, trusted and validated basis}

&#x2705; **On-line personal study**

- Familiarise yourself with SPT, as a way of saving yourself time later. Here you’ll find a worked out physics narrative, QuoteThis{misconceptions} and misrepresentations with commentary, giving you suggestions as to how to deal with them, and some teaching approaches to share. You might also find the overviews useful. Expect to share particular nuggets from SPT with teachers for both follow up and for their preparation.

&#x2705; **Interacting, face to face or on-line**

- Explore how experienced coaches have used SPT, experience suggests yet more focus on the electric circuits, energy and forces topics, as these reach into many other topics.

&#x2705; **Thinking and reflective writing**

- Ensure you are clear on the core ideas, and on the reasoning supporting these choices.

&#x2795; Going further

- Buddy up with another coach(or any other willing volunteer) and practice some mini-coaching sessions, tackling some questions from teachers.

StepHeader{Step Four – IGB and Diversity}

&#x2705; **On-line personal study**

Girls can do physics and do it very well. However, many do not choose to continue to study it post-16. Explore the issues by reading through IOP reports and resources.

&#x2705; **Interacting, face to face or on-line**

- Discuss coaching and IGB/diversity with other new and experienced coaches: what have they found in schools and with teachers?  Observe what happens in your sessions.  Are some participants dominating the discussions or practical work? How could you manage the environment to make sure that everyone has an equitable experience? Discuss the lack of diversity in physics with other coaches and ways in which it can be addressed.

&#x2795; going further

- The overall environment of a school plays a role in whether girls will continue with physics post-16. Read up on the steps that schools can take to address gender stereotypes and promote gender equality as part of a whole school initiative.

InsertLinkTA{Steps schools can take}{http://www.iop.org/education/teacher/support/girls_physics/resources/file_69811.pdf}

&#x2705; **Thinking and reflective writing**

-Think about your personal biases.  Do you think of girls as hardworking and boys as smart?  Or physics as inherently hard?  You can test your male/science bias:

Where might these biases influence your coaching practice, in seeking to affect teachers? 

InsertLinkTA{Guidance, towards balance}{http://www.iop.org/education/teacher/support/girls_physics/resources-and-guidance-for-teachers/file_68643.pdf}

How can we bring these ideas into your sessions, to help teachers reflect and become more inclusive?


StepHeader{Step Five – Run some CPD sessions}

&#x2705; **Face to face**

- Get your hands dirty – do some sessions or practice with willing volunteers.
- Remember that there is advice and existing good practice– you should not feel thrown back on only your own experience and resources.

InsertLinkTA{coaching advice galore}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/coaching}

- Keep seeking the advice of more experienced colleagues, so we can build a community.

&#x2705; **Interacting, face to face or on-line**

- Discuss your plans and planning with experienced colleagues.

&#x2795; going further

- Share plans for sessions  and guides on TalkPhysics coaching group.


StepHeader{Step Six - Regional coaching seminars}

&#x2705; **Interacting, face to face or on-line**

- Attend some regional coaching seminars and contribute to coaching practice group on TalkPhysics.
- Share some thinking, experiences, questions and coaching resources

&#x2795; Going further

- Suggest some issues that could be tackled in the regional seminars

StepHeader{Beyond Step Six - Iterate to Cphys}

Continue as a member of the community of coaches: staying in contact with colleagues and offering and receiving advice. Run sessions; reflect on sessions; share insight and experience from sessions. As you build a body of reflective practice, so you will be collecting evidence towards CPhys.

Make use of formal and informal advice: both online and off-line.
