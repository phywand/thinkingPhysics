WebTitle{Subtractive filters not â€“ filters multiply}

Here's a connection that I'd not made until recently. Absorption happens by taking out a constant fraction of the light per unit thickness (say 0.1), so the  transmitted light through n layers is NumberSuper{0.9}{n}. That is, filtration is essentially multiplicative. Yet we refer to colour subtraction, and subtractive filters. Not helpful, as this supports errors in reasoning. My thanks to the MUSE group for pointing this connection  out. The up-to-date SPT (web) materials now no longer contain this unhelpful term, except to explain a little and to allow you to use the index to find out where not to use it.
