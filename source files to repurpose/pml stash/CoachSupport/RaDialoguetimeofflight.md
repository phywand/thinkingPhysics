WebTitle{ Making strategic investments}

TeacherOne{I'm wondering how to teach about light years.}

TeacherTwo{That's just about multiplying up the numbers &mdash;just tell them it's shorthand because it's rather a lot of miles.}

TeacherThree{Maybe we can be a bit more ambitious than that. There are a number of places where it's quite natural to determine distances by time of flight, or trip time.}

TeacherOne{Isn't that just making things difficult? Surely you're just replacing one difficulty with another?}

TeacherTwo{What connections are you suggesting? I've learnt, after many years in the classroom,  that it's worth plotting your way through the difficulties that you choose, so as to make fruitful links and learning possible.}

TeacherThree{Well, it does rather depend where you want to end up, but I think there are two reasonable targets: that QuoteThis{looking out at our surroundings is always looking back in time} and that QuoteThis{there is something rather special about the speed of light}.}

TeacherOne{So where do you start?}

TeacherThree{At a human scale&mdash;the foot(30 cm) is very useful, as it is takes light nearly exactly one nanosecond to cover that distance. Then engage children's imagination to point out that the you see everything not as it is, but as it was, with the conversion readily to hand: for every extra foot  between you and the thing you're finding out about, there's an inevitable delay of on nanosecond.}

TeacherOne{That sounds dangerously close to relativistic thinking&hellip; but I can see how you'd develop it as far as the light-year.}

TeacherTwo{And do you expect them to know about nanoseconds?}

TeacherThree{It is a really good foundation, and no, I don't: learning about nanoseconds is an evolving part of the story, to be developed. Or, to put it another way, it's a  QuoteThis{difficulty} that I've chosen to embrace, because it presents a fruitful challenge.}

TeacherOne{What else can you build on this idea of taking trip time seriously?}

TeacherTwo{That'll have to be for another time, as we've got to go and teach.}
