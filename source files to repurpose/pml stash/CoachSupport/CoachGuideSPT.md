InsertLinkPN{downloads and announcements group}{http://www.talkphysics.org/groups/1178}

There is a coaching practice group on TalkPhysics, which provides for shared and structured dialogue.

@sptsensei is not currently twitteractive.

If all else fails there is always the fallback email of SPT@iop.org.

StepHeader{Accessing the resources}

There live and current version of all topics is at supportingphysicsteaching.net which is tablet and desktop friendly (it is not optimised for the smaller screens of mobile phones).

Access this version from a unified jump off point

http://supportingphysicsteaching.net

InsertLinkPN{jump off}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/}

You could try a more graphical version at:

InsertLinkPN{map and topic ball}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/map}

Or search the topics at:

InsertLinkPN{search}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/search}

SpacingLinebreak

Below this point many URLs are explicit, so that you can see the patterns.

Otherwise use the links above and bookmark...

You can directly access each topic from:

http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/EeHome, substituting the first two letters to jump straight to the home page of the chosen topic (say, SoHome).

The full list of topic abbreviations is: Ee,El,Em,En,Es,Fm,Fo,Li,Ma,Mo,Ra,So.

For a more graphical version try:

http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/EeMap, substituting the first two letters to jump straight to the home page of the chosen topic (say, FmMap).

You can navigate amongst topics from within any home page.

There are 15 topics, each which is constructed of 2-5 episodes, intended to be read in order.

For access outside the session you can select a particular thread  (PN, TL or TA), in a particular episode, in your topic.

You can reach episode directly by setting the filename( eg: http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/Es02TA.html).

Topic, episode number and thread define the filename, to which you must add the extension ".html".

You can navigate amongst threads from within any thread page.

StepHeader{Topic jump off points}

In addition to the QuoteThis{standard} ways in, there are a number of other top-level ways in – thinking of physics you might just follow QuoteThis{supportingphysicsteaching.net} with QuoteThis{/} and then one of electricity, light, motion, radiation, force or energy. These give a short menu which points to possibilities within SPT related to the topic you've chosen. Suggestions for further topic words that teachers might type to SPT@iop.org, thanks.

StepHeader{For reference: A model of the resource}

SPT consists of fifteen topics: topics are built of between two and five episodes, with three threads to an episode, and a topic home page to glue it all together and to provide overviews of the topic.

InsertGraphic{SPTGraphics/UserGuideTopics_INSO.svg}

The three threads are: Physics Narrative; Teaching and Learning Issues; Teaching Approaches.

InsertGraphic{SPTGraphics/UserGuideThreads_INSO.svg}

Each thread is a single web page.

This design is not accidental, and reflects a good deal of thinking about the professional competences of teachers of physics.

InsertGraphic{SPTGraphics/UserGuideRationale_INSO.svg}

Each thread is constructed of numbered nuggets of different kinds. Each nugget consists of a number of steps, delimited by header text. The table of contents on the topic home pages point to nuggets, as these are the smallest addressable items in the flow of the thread.

InsertGraphic{SPTGraphics/UserGuideStructure_INSO.svg}

The interactives, explorable diagrams and interactive diagrams tell a story graphically, that complements the written words. For that reason they're best accessed via the threads. You can embed them in TalkPhysics using iframes. Teachers can get their own copies by using the download links from within the interactive. Please note that embedding in PowerPoint fails as this program does not provide the necessary script support. There are likely to be more security issues in typical school installations if the interactives are run locally.

Support sheets and support files are also mounted at fixed urls. Again you can find the location of these by following the links from the threads. Please encourage teachers to get their own by following the links from their own browsing.

The principle is that every potentially useful element has its own URL, findable using the tools below.

StepHeader{Finder tools for quick access}

There are several that you might bookmark:

InsertLinkPN{A finder for any nugget}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/NuggetFinder}

This, as the link suggests, allows you to filter and sort through a list of all nuggets to rapidly locate a nugget.

InsertLinkPN{A finder for items you might use to probe understandings}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/ProbeFinder}

Again filter and sort to locate resources from SPT to use in probing understanding.


InsertLinkPN{Representing and reasoning in physics}{ http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/RRP}

Points of view about depicting and interpreting physics.

InsertLinkPN{Authoring, editing and representing in physics}{ http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/AER}

More or less guidelines for writing and drawing about physics in sympathy with the SPT approach

InsertLinkPN{A representations finder, to locate diagram elements}{ http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/REP}

Just to save you having to redraw lots of standard SPT elements.

InsertLinkPN{An interactives finder, to locate the Flash-based interactive}{ http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/INT}

Some of these are no longer accessible via the main resource, as it becomes more mobile-friendly.


TeacherTip{Don't forget the topic overviews: some coaches have recommended these as the basis for a session.}

StepHeader{Directions to a single nugget}

Each nugget has its own URL, so a web page containing just that nugget, where the URL is constructed from the topic, episode, thread and nugget number.

You can use this pattern  to generate the URL by inspecting the address bar of browser whilst you are looking at the complete thread and use this to direct people to a single nugget.

e.g. http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/En01PNnugget03.html

Each topic of isolated nuggets can be navigated from a nuggets links page, eg:

e.g. http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/EnLinks

StepHeader{Collated suggestions and decisions for a topic}

These are selections of nuggets from the the TL thread of each episode, for a topic.

eg of URL:

http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/LiDecisions.html

http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/FoSuggestions.html

StepHeader{To use in your sessions}

Please show the web version: software is available that lets you store a site locally, even for an iPad if you are not confident of live web access in the session location.

Bookmark or grab a web page of one of the component files, or selections of nuggets.

Please share direct links to nuggets as follow up to, or preparation for, sessions, so that teachers get a chance to engage fully. Refer to individual nuggets of SPT for teacher’s follow up work, rather than sharing a hail of URLs, as this enables the teachers to be systematic and self-paced in their study, which is not possible with a collection of web links, unless you have the time to write a commentary on each, explaining how and why it was selected.

StepHeader{Embedding elements in conversations on TalkPhysics}

The following instructions only apply if you want to support your teachers by embedding individual elements in a conversation that you're running on TalkPhysics. (So to promote engagement with the resource, and to support online coaching or mentoring).

It's strongly recommended to embed individual nuggets. The QuoteThis{e} button visible on the right hand side of every isolated nugget pops up a box containing the embed code. Copy and paste this in the text editor (not the visual editor) as a part of a post.

As many other elements in SPT also have URLs, you can also use iframes to embed these, or link directly to them.


StepHeader{Notes on the SPT PDFs}

For now, PDFs of the topics are available, which contain dated versions of the  content on the web pages.

Teachers  who feel the need for the older PDF versions can obtain a set from the information button on the home page of the appropriate topic, as either:

* full PDF version for use on laptops and desktops

* light PDF version for use on tablets and mobile devices

In either case unzip the files to a folder of your choice before trying to use them.

The topic menu is a multi-page document which links the whole topic together and provides overviews.

Each thread is a single PDF, so there are three PDFs per episode.

In each PDF episode, each Physics Narrative, Teaching and Learning Issues, or Teaching Approaches document has both a table of contents and an index (first two pages of each).

The threads are divided into numbered nuggets, which are composed of a variable number of numbered steps, each of which occupies one page.

Index terms and the table of contents both point to nuggets.

Apart from the content on the pages, there are links to retrieve supporting PDFs and supporting files and launch interactive elements. All such links are mediated through the user's web browser.

The PDF versions of the topics are just PDF files. Many PDF readers will allow you to search whole folders of files for particular words. The Mac OS indexes the text of all PDFs, so you could also use that facility to perform a cunning search, or a similar facility in your chosen operating system.

StepHeader{Mobile}

Given that a lot of the traffic is now mobile, all 11-14 topics have  been stripped of Flash (as of 2017-06), Comments if any, might guide future action. For now, it is possible, even if not easy, to run Flash on common mobile operating systems.
