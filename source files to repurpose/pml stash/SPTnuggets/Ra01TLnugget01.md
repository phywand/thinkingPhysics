ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- keep the different radiating mechanisms separate
- separate the phenomena from the explanations
- explore the full range of behaviours of each family of radiations
- identify and demonstrate the phenomena
- account for the reduction of intensity with increasing separation of detector from source
- build on what is known from earlier work in QuoteThis{light} and QuoteThis{sound}
- exploit a full range of applications to draw out the wave character of radiations

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }

ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- separate the lived-in world of phenomena from the models that account for those phenomena 
- introduce amplitude and frequency as fundamental
- characterise a wave as delayed mimicry, without making the idea of a wave too complex
- introduce the idea of the trip time, as an essential corollary of radiations travelling
- develop model-based explanations with real power, rather than give homely analogies
- develop accounts of increasingly complex situations, relating these to simpler situations
- present the central ideas of radiating as a unifying theme

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
