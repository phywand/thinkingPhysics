How to:

ListInformation
- separate rays (the theoretical constructs) from beams (the physical)
- connect the predictions of ray models back to phenomena
- motivate the move from the phenomena to a ray model
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- exemplify the construction of ray models for particular purposes
- introduce the selection of rays
- establish the conventions for ray models
- identify the simplifications made in constructing a ray model
- put the ray model to use
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
