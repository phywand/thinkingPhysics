ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Early introductions to forces in equilibrium will be via static situations. However, rather than identifying forces which sum to zero, children often describe such static situations as having no forces. This is an understandable conclusion and one that is almost correct. In equilibrium there is no resultant force.

You can subvert this natural tendency by identifying the forces acting from looking at the physical situation SymbolEndash an approach that is built into the SPT: Forces topic. We&apos;d suggest not using equilibrium as a means of identifying forces. However it may be useful, in tricky situations, as a backup, and as a means of budging individuals towards looking again at the situation because you believe that there is another force yet to be identified.
