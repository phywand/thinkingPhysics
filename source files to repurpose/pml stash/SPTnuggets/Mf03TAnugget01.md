WebTitle{Selecting and developing activities(Suggestions)}

TeacherTip{Based on the Physics Narrative and the Teaching and Learning Issues}

ThinkHeader{Ideas to emphasise here}

ListInformation
- connect interactions between objects with the idea of a force
- adopt consistent conventions about where and how the arrows are drawn
- relate floating and sinking to forces, not to rules about displaced fluids
- relate QuoteThis{friction} to the mechanisms of friction
- focus on the physical reasons for placing arrows
- giving real experiences of forces acting at a distance
- exploiting the tangible effects of magnets in regions of space around the magnet
- relate electric, magnetic and gravity forces, without conflating them
- separate the mass of an object from the force of gravity acting on the object, without being dogmatic

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Strategies for supporting learning}

ListInformation
- draw on learners conception of their own actions and relate these to force
- explore and expose children&apos;s ideas of forces
- draw out children&apos;s everyday ideas about motion and the forces required
- introduce children to a new way of seeing SymbolEndash with forces
- convince children that inanimate things can push, just like they can
- developed the idea that a mechanism underpins the interaction that is replaced by force
- convince children that air can exert forces
- draw on children&apos;s own experience of action at the distance, probably through experiences with magnets
- draw on children&apos;s experiences, some of which will be vicarious, to establish the reality of gravity in space
- explore something of the mystery of action at a distance

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children&apos;s ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- drawing arrows next two objects, or near objects, when you intend the force be acting on the object
- don&apos;t act as if the placing of arrows is obvious and open to a simple inspection
- don&apos;t refer to forces cancelling out
- avoid using complex objects on which forces might be acting (with internally moving parts SymbolEndash bicycles, cars, people.)
- using friction as a blanket term, without reference to its physical origins
- treating contact forces exerted by inanimate objects as obvious
- stating, without sharing the appropriate experiences that give the statements meaning
- treating action at a distance as obviously acceptable
- acting as if the similarities between the three non-contact forces always have been obvious
- over-emphasising the similarities
- conflating the terminology and representations for the three different forces

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
