StepHeader{Purpose}

The purpose of this activity is to use a simple modelling tool to model the behaviour of a hydraulic system.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- the modelling program VnR running on a computer connected to a large display
- three prepared models
- this interactive object InsertLink{MaThreeHydraulicSystemsFILE}

StepHeader{Happens}

Show the interactive object, drawing attention to the connections between the tube diameters and the forces. Then allow the pupils to work with the modelling tool VnR, using the support sheet to guide them. This leads them through three models closely related to the interactive objects SymbolEndash so it may pay to keep this on the large display SymbolEndash then challenge them to build one of their own.
