StepHeader{Energy supplied to your house SymbolEndash fluctuating demands}

Running out of fuel in a car is always very inconvenient, but it's not the end of the world! A short trip to the petrol station to collect a few litres of fuel and you are off again. The fuel is low in mass and releases energy from its store quickly. You can accelerate away to make up for lost time.

Apart from occasional catastrophic failures, the energy supply to your house fortunately does not run out. The national grid controller matches the input to the demands on the system by varying the rate of depletion of energy stores (associated with fuels such as gas, coal and oil). The variation in demand can be enormous.

The biggest fluctuations are associated with breaks in TV programmes. Here are some (relatively recent QuoteThis{pickups} (short term increases):

In other words, on Saturday 22 November 2003, with a large fraction of the nation watching the Rugby World Cup Final on the TV, there was a huge increase in demand for electricity (an increase of 2100 million joule of energy each second at half time), as everybody made cups of tea to settle their nerves.

Given these fluctuations in demand, power stations that can quickly change their rate of supply are essential, and some of their generating capacity is held in reserve. Hydro-electric and gas powered stations are two such types of station. Nuclear stations are very slow to change their output. Solar, tidal, wind and wave powered electricity generation cannot be varied on demand other than switching in or out what is available at that time.

Nor can energy be easily stored up against demand. One of the few effective ways is to pump water uphill, to be run down through the power station again when the demand is there. Another may be to generate hydrogen, but scientists, engineers and politicians are still working on that one.
