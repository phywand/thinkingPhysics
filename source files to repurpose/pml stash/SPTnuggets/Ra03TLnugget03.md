WebTitle{Sources in step(Challenge)}

StepHeader{Two waves interacting: it is essential to know about the starting conditions }

WrongTrack{To find out whether two sets of waves are in step at a certain common point, all we need to know is the trip time. If the trip time is the same for both waves they must arrive in step.}

RightLines{If you have two sets of waves from different sources they will arrive at a common point in step if they are in step with each other at their respective starting points; they are of the same frequency; and they have the same trip time. The technical term for two sources being QuoteThis{in step} is that they are QuoteThis{coherent}. To be coherent, the two sources need not be exactly in step: they might be exactly out of step or somewhere in between. The critical point is that there is a constant, unchanging QuoteThis{phase relationship} between the two sources.}
