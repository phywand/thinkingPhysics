StepHeader{Reflection from surfaces}

Light beams are reflected from surfaces according to the law of reflection, which states that QuoteThis{the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection}.

Here an explanation of the law builds up, step by step. (Remember that rays are figments of your imagination.)

The angles of incidence (i) and reflection (r) are measured between the incident (incoming) and reflected (outgoing) rays and the normal line. The normal line is a construction line drawn perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point where the incident ray strikes.
