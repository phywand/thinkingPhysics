Lunar eclipses occur when the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon so that the Earth casts its shadow on the Moon. As the Earth is much larger than the Moon, lunar eclipses occur more frequently than solar eclipses.

The photograph shows one that occurred in 2007. 

Such eclipses are normally total.
