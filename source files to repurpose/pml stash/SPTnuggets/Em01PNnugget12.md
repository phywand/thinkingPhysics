For quantitative work, the fact that a magnet will cause a force to act on a current-carrying wire is used to measure the strength of the magnetic field. If there is a direct current in a wire, a nearby magnet will cause a force to be exerted between the magnet and the wire. If the direction of the magnetic field is at a right angle to that of the current, and the length of the wire is 1 metre, carrying a current of ValueUnit{1}{ampere}, then a force of ValueUnit{1}{newton} will act on the wire when the magnetic field strength is equal to ValueUnit{1}{tesla}, ValueUnit{1}{T}. So the strength of a magnetic field is measured in units of tesla (T). Nikola Tesla was a Yugoslav Serb physicist (1856&ndash;1943).

A magnetic field of ValueUnit{1}{tesla} (T) is a strong field. The bar magnets found in schools create field strengths of the order of ValueExponent{1}{-4}{tesla}. The Earth's magnetic field near the UK has a strength of about one tenth of this, ValueExponent{1}{-5}{tesla}.
