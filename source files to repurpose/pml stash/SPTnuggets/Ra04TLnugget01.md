ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- deal with perceptions of risk
- draw out children's understandings of QuoteThis{radioactive}
- connect ionising radiations with other radiations
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- separate ionisation from contamination
- separate penetrating power from activity
- separate damage done from activity
- connect ionising radiations with other radiations
- explain half-life, connecting this to randomness events, and to safety

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
