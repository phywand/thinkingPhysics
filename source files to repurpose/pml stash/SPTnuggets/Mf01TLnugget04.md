ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Most children are comfortable with the concept of speed, though they may not have a neat definition for it. However, comparisons and calculations of speed may raise difficulties.

So can under-defined questions. Speed is always with respect to a point of view, and sometimes we need to carefully state the point of view to avoid ambiguity.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Take care to specify a point of view when you ask for a speed. The speed specifies the rate at which one object moves away from another.

So you need to locate yourself SymbolEndash perhaps you&apos;re moving along with one of the objects.

If you report something as QuoteThis{at rest}, all we can work out from that is that you and it are moving along together SymbolEndash the distance between you and the object is not changing. We don&apos;t know of absolute point of view against which we can all agree that something is stationary.
