StepHeader{Purpose}

A quick experiment to get a feel for the differing effects of the action of a force applied at different lengths from the pivot.

To get some experience of making and manipulating a physical model.

To appreciate the care that must be taken in order to use the results from the model to make predictions about real behaviour, and to understand the system.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- small rectangles of aluminium sheet, approximately ValueUnit{10}{centimetre} by ValueUnit{4}{centimetre} (other rigid rectangles could be substituted SymbolEndash but do ensure that the edges are smooth)

StepHeader{Happens}

Work in pairs. One pupil acts as the door hinge, gripping one end of the rectangle between finger and thumb. The other tries to open the door by pushing with a single finger.

You might ask the pair to model the following situations, recording their actions for a discussion by a simple plan view sketch.

ListInformation
- Opening a door by pushing near the hinge.
- Opening a door by pushing in the middle.
- Opening a door by pushing as far from the hinge as possible.

From these three, they should be able to say something about the relative difficulty of opening the door, provided they have designed their experiments with care (kept the same hinges). Asking what they have done to make their findings reliable should allow them to identify this as the significant factor.

We suggest you concentrate on the balance between the force their finger exerts on the door and lengths to the pivot as the two key factors to draw out.

Then you might ask them to model hinges that make the door harder to open. (Careful experimenters will find two ways to do this: By gripping harder, and by sliding the finger and thumb farther up the door. You might manage to make something of this, drawing out the effects of force and length for the hinge as well as for the finger doing the opening).
