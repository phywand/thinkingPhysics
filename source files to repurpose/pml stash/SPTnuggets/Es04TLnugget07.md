WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- teaching a sequence determined by the complexity of model explaining the illumination
- relating your models to observations that the children make, both inside and outside the laboratory
- paying attention to the issue of relative scale in your depictions
- ensuring that the phenomena to be modelled are well characterised before the modelling starts
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- assuming that the models are obvious
- building models without the physical experiences that make them seem real
- not QuoteThis{running} the models once they are built, so that you can show how they work
- not relating the models back to the observations
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
