ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

This learning challenge involves being clear about the physical nature of sounds&hellip;  what they really are.

The challenge here is for pupils to come to recognise and to understand the scientific view of what sound is: the disturbance created by the source, which travels out through the surrounding medium. The disturbance itself consists of successive regions of high- and low-density air created by the forwards and backwards motion of millions of air particles. No QuoteThis{to and fro} motion SymbolEndash no sound.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

It is worth emphasising the message:

TeacherSpeak{If it does not involve the to-and-fro movement of a medium, is is not a sound.}

So sound is not QuoteThis{stored} on a CD; it is not transmitted to a radio set; it is not delivered down a cable to a television.

Sounds can be produced by decoding what is stored on these artefacts. You need to take care to refer to sound only when you want to speak of the to and fro movements of the medium. Sound only exists in each of these cases after the loudspeaker.
