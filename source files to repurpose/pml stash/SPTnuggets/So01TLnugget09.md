TeacherTip{Use rays are used to model light, but not sound.}

Here is why.

In explaining the properties of light we suggest constructing diagrams based on light rays, which are imaginary. Rays can be imagined to represent  infinitely thin beams of light.

In optics, light rays are used a lot because real light beams act in much the same way as the model rays. In other words, light really does travel along well defined paths, which do not diverge too much with distance.

Sound does not travel in sharply defined beams. Instead it spreads much more as it goes SymbolEndash beams are very hard to maintain.
