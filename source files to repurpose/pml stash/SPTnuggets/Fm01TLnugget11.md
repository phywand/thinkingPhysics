StepHeader{Choosing and representing}

TeacherTip{There's a very important connection between mass, force and acceleration: I choose the mass and the force. The acceleration is a result of these choices. Remind yourself of that by writing: FractionBdCeqA{acceleration}{force}{mass} each time.}

TeacherTip{To be even more precise, in this relationship there is one thing which is shown by just a number (mass is a scalar), and two things are shown by a representation where direction is important (force and acceleration), so we use ordered sets of numbers for this pair. Now you'd remind yourself of that by writing: FractionABC{VectorOver{a}}{VectorOver{F}}{QuantitySymbol{m}}.}
