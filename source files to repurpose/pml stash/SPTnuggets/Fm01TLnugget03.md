StepHeader{Empirical discoveries, computing, and defining}

The equals sign appears in many relationships, but also in computer programs. In these two contexts the meanings are different, but the symbol is the same.

When we use it for doing calculations there is a danger that we conflate the two meanings, tending to undermine both.

There are three separate use cases:
ListInformation
- Assignment SymbolEndash used in computations.
- Equality SymbolEndash used in empirical assertions.
- Identity SymbolEndash used in definitions.
ListInformationEnd

Taking care with symbols, one might use different symbols for different meanings. The difficulty is in computation, both when using pencil and paper, and when using software.

In many cases in physics, an QuoteThis{=} is often making an assertion about the world. It's a claim that what appears on its left hand side is identical in value (so physical quantity SymbolEndash number plus unit) to what appears on its right hand side. You test the validity of this assertion of the relationship between the two sets of values by empirical test. The use of the QuoteThis{=} sign is the final step in explaining how you think the world works.

In some other cases, the QuoteThis{=} sign plays a part in creating a framework that allows you to describe the world. In this case you're defining new entities in terms of existing ones. These are not empirical statements, and so could not be wrong (they're stipulative definitions).

Here is a simple example:FractionBdCeqA{distance}{duration}{speed}

There is no experiment you could do to show that this is wrong.

(Some choose to write these kinds of relationships as:FractionBlock{distance}{duration} SymbolEquivalent speed. We've not chosen that representation here, because it's not widespread.)
