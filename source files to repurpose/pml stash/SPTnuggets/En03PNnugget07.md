Think of a gas fire at home. As the gas burns, energy is continuously shifted from the concentrated chemical store of the gas to the thermal store of the surroundings as they warm up. Once the gas combines with oxygen, energy from the chemical store is dissipated and there's no getting it back. This image of the continuous dissipation of energy gives us good reason to be careful in our use of energy resources. The full range of energy resources that we use can be classified as renewable or non-renewable. Renewable resources are those that can be replaced within human time scales. Non-renewable resources are those that cannot.

It takes millennia for decaying trees to become oil (a non-renewable resource), yet only decades for trees to grow ready to be harvested as firewood (a renewable resource). Both of these resources ultimately depend on photosynthesis to shift energy arriving from the nuclear store in the Sun to the chemical store in the hydrocarbons and oxygen. Here the pathway that links the Sun with the plants involves the passage of light: the nuclear store is emptied by radiation.

Renewable resources are not infinite: they depend on the Sun. For the next 5 billion years or so, the Sun will shift energy by radiation at a fairly steady rate, so depleting its nuclear store. As long as our demands stay within this fixed rate of supply, sensible use can be made of renewable resources. Bio-fuel plantations, wind, wave, solar and hydro-power stations can all be used to divert some energy from the Sun's store for our use.

Tidal flows are somewhat different, drawing on the  energy in the kinetic store associated with the orbiting of the Moon around the Earth and both the Earth and Moon around the Sun, so (very gradually) reducing the speed of their orbits.

As outlined earlier, national and international energy demands fluctuate with time. One key consideration in meeting these demands lies in the use of nuclear power. Nuclear power stations are based on the process of nuclear fission. This process involves mining the raw materials from which fuel rods are made: this generates radioactive waste products that will be around for millennia. Fission also happens quite naturally at low rates throughout the Earth's interior wherever the appropriate nuclei are found, providing some of the energy that keeps the Earth warm. This is tapped into by geothermal power stations.

Given that our society is reluctant to live within the rate of replacement of energy resources provided by the sun, an understanding of our consumption of energy resources will continue to be an essential part of the education of every citizen.
