ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- develop precise descriptions, building on everyday experiences
- exploit the availability of technology such as videocameras to tell stories about motion and recording of motion
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- talk helpfully about clock time and duration
- separate instantaneous from average
- emphasise that all motion is relative motion
- exploit common patterns in thinking
- be clear about what is simply a convention, albeit a very useful one
- exploit clear diagrammatic conventions

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
