Frequency and amplitude provide a very good start to describing sounds, but most sounds that we hear in daily life consist of more than one frequency.

This is clearly illustrated when you look at the graphic equaliser display, which actually shows the different ranges of frequencies present in the music.

Just as we recognise familiar faces, so too can we spot familiar voices. You hear a voice much as you see a face SymbolEndash it is instantly recognisable. You can certainly recognise the voice if the loudness is altered, perhaps even if the pitch is changed. The collection of amplitudes and frequencies in the voice, even if distorted, give you many clues.
