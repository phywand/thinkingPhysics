This a part of a suggested sequence:

StepHeader{Purpose}

Pupils will very often agree that to be able to see, light must enter the eye. However it is possible to set up situations where this apparently firmly-fixed belief can be productively challenged, and thereby strengthened. This is the aim for this demonstration.

ListEquipment
- a source of fine dust SymbolEndash board duster or talc
- a bright torch that provides an intense, fine beam of light

StepHeader{Happens}

Set up the torch so that, when switched on, the beam travels across the front of the room, landing on a white screen so that a bright spot is clearly visible.

Start by describing the set-up to the children, showing the torch and pointing to the screen across the room at which the beam is directed. For the sake of this demonstration, all that the children need to know is that the torch provides an intense, or very powerful, beam of light.

Explain that you are going to put the room lights out in a moment and ask the children to predict what they will see when the lights are out (with a good black-out) and the torch is switched on. This is where the children&apos;s ideas about seeing are challenged.

StepHeader{Challenging predictions}

PupilSpeak{Former opinion}{You&apos;ll see the beam cutting through the darkness.}

PupilSpeak{Latter opinion}{You&apos;ll just see a spot on the screen where the beam hits.}

Experience has shown that the former opinion is very common among children. Make sure to bring it out into the open, so that it gets effectively challenged. It&apos;s not enough to simply show the process and assume the learning will be automatic.

Now switch on the torch (with appropriate theatrical build-up). Nothing seems to happen. A red spot appears on the screen at the side of the room, but the torch beam itself can&apos;t be seen.

The big question is: QuoteThis{Why can&apos;t we see the torch beam?} (Because none of the torch light is entering our eyes). This can lead to an interesting discussion of situations where it is possible to see beams of light cutting through the air. Pupils may well refer to laser shows at pop concerts, the projection lights in cinemas, car headlamps on a foggy night. In each of these cases there is something which will scatter the light into our eyes.

An interesting follow-up question is: QuoteThis{How come we can see the spot on the screen?} (Here torch light is being reflected in all directions from the wall and some travels to our eyes).

Use chalk dust from the board rubber (if you still use one) or a fine powder such as talc, or alternatively a fine water spray to scatter the beam. The room light is off and the effect is stunning as the beam becomes visible as light is scattered away from it.
