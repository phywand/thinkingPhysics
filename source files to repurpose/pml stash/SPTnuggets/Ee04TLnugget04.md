The concept of efficiency has a precise meaning in physics, which is likely to be different from QuoteThis{everyday} understandings of what is meant by efficiency. The efficiency of any device is defined as: EfficiencyCalc{WordSub{energy}{out}}{WordSub{energy}{in}}.

This relationship assumes that the energy output and input are measured over the same period of time. An equivalent form for the relationship is: EfficiencyCalc{WordSub{power}{out}}{WordSub{power}{in}}.

Here we are comparing the energy out and in per second.

Supposing we think about a domestic filament bulb. For every ValueUnit{100}{watt} of power supplied to the bulb, about ValueUnit{5}{watt} goes to lighting the surroundings whilst the remaining ValueUnit{95}{watt} goes to heating the bulb and surroundings. The efficiency of the bulb can be calculated easily(using the relationship quoted above, EfficiencyCalc{WordSub{power}{out}}{WordSub{power}{in}} and put the values in: FractionBlock{5 watt}{100 watt} SymbolMultipliedby ValueUnit{100}{&percnt;} to get an efficiency of ValueUnit{5}{&percnt;}.

In this case the WordSub{power}{out}  is taken as being the useful energy output per second. The job of an electric light bulb is to provide light. As can be seen from the calculation, it doesn't do this very efficiently because more power is switched to heating than to lighting.
