StepHeader{Bringing together two sets of constraints}

ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- develop the model of the nuclear atom
- maintain the connection between randomness for an individual nucleus and predictability over an ensemble
- keep the atomic electrons out of the model
- draw on existing understandings of energy to separate nuclear and atomic processes
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }

ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- separate transmutations from annihilations
- relate different representations of exponential decay
- relate emissions to transmutations
- explain why some nuclei are radioactive and some not
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
