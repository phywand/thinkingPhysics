StepHeader{A true story}

A teacher was working with her Key Stage 1 class on this topic and asked them what they thought. All the children agreed with the statement above.

The next week, the Moon was in the morning sky and the teacher took them to the classroom window to see it. The children were totally bemused that what they had thought was not right SymbolEndash so much so that a few were really worried and one even asked: QuoteThis{Are we going to die?}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

We think that it is important to find out what children think and then allow them to make observations to test out their ideas.

By the nature of the topic, it is hard to find linked practical work in this topic so questioning to promote thinking and discussion between children, combined with acting-out and making representations will be focii.
