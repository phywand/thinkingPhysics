If one object has twice the mass of another the Earth will pull it with twice the force:

Box of mass ValueUnit{2}{kilogram}: Pull of Earth is ValueUnit{20}{newton}

Box of mass ValueUnit{4}{kilogram}: Pull of Earth is ValueUnit{40}{newton}

Since the larger box has twice the force pulling on it (and this is what you feel when you hold it in your hand), it is tempting to predict that it will fall more quickly. But, the larger box has twice as much mass to set into motion, so it will accelerate at the same rate as a lighter object.

A force of ValueUnit{20}{newton} on a ValueUnit{2}{kilogram} mass has the same effect as a force of ValueUnit{40}{newton} on a ValueUnit{4}{kilogram} mass.

In fact, we can use Newton's second law of motion (see the SPT: Forces topic) to calculate the acceleration in each of these cases.

This is quite unlike the case for horizontal motion, where you can vary the force exerted and the mass independently.

FractionABC{acceleration}{force}{mass}

For the smaller mass, the force is ValueUnit{20}{N} and the mass is ValueUnit{2}{kg}, so:

FractionBdCeqA{ValueUnit{20}{N}}{ValueUnit{2}{kg}}{ValueUnit{10}{m s -2}}

For the smaller mass, the force is ValueUnit{40}{N} and the mass is ValueUnit{4}{kg}, so:

FractionBdCeqA{ValueUnit{40}{N}}{ValueUnit{4}{kg}}{ValueUnit{10}{m s -2}}

Both objects fall with an acceleration of about ValueUnit{10}{metre second -2}.

This is often referred to as the acceleration due to gravity and is the value obtained if the air resistance force acting on the falling object is negligible.
