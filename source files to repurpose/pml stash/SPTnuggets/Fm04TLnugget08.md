WebTitle{Giving equations and asking questions(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{Working backwards can promote thinking}

Starting out at different points in a conventional presentation, then working backwards and forwards from those, can result in illuminating discussions.

You could select an equation, such as: ValueUnit{30}{kilogram metre inverse second} = velocity   SymbolMultipliedby  ValueUnit{50}{kilogram}, and get students to write down a question to which this could be the beginnings of a solution. Group work, where students assess the reasonableness of each other's claims, leads to lively discussions.

Selecting suitable equations can lead to a much deeper understanding of the significance of such relationships than is engendered by the QuoteThis{question} SymbolEndash QuoteThis{choose equation} SymbolEndash QuoteThis{plug in numbers} SymbolEndash QuoteThis{give answer} route. At least it provides some variety.

TeacherTip{Hand out any equation and then ask students to write a question to which the equation is an answer.}
