It&apos;s possible that this kind of thinking is encouraged in children by QuoteThis{donation} models that suggest that everything comes from the battery, and is then carried round to the bulb.

It would appear that when we turn on a switch the electric charges move immediately in all parts of the circuit and instantly light a bulb. At home, there&apos;s no noticeable delay between your finger activating the switch and the LED bulb glowing SymbolEndash even though the switch and bulb may be a long way apart.

Actually it does take a very short time for the charges to start moving. The electric field that sets the charges in motion takes a finite time to pass through the wires. The field propagates (moves) at approximately the speed of light: ValueUnit{300,000}{kilometre /second}, that is ValueUnit{300}{millimetre} in a thousand-millionth of a second.

Does this delay matter? An electrical signal would take a mere hundredth of a second to pass from the UK to the USA through cables under the Atlantic Ocean. However, a modern computer will time itself on a signal changing many millions of times a second. With signals that are fractions of a millionth of a second long, even small delays in signals travelling along wires must be taken into account when designing circuit boards.

The bulb in our circuit does not turn on immediately, but the delay is so short that it is only significant in situations far removed from school laboratory benches and domestic lighting.
