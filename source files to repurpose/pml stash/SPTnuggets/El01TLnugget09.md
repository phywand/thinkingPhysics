WebTitle{What fixes how big or small the electric current is?(Challenge)}

StepHeader{The battery QuoteThis{gives} a current}

WrongTrack{The current flowing in the circuit is ValueUnit{2}{ampere}. The battery is giving a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere}.}

RightLines{The current in the circuit is ValueUnit{2}{ampere}. This rate of flow of charge is fixed by choosing the battery and the lamp, so the voltage and the resistance.}

StepHeader{The circuit as a system}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Having been introduced to the idea of measuring electric currents, some pupils see the battery as providing a fixed current. This incorrect line of thinking may be linked to the earlier QuoteThis{wrong track} idea that the current originates in the battery.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

You should always talk so that the pupils see the circuit as a whole system with the charge being set in motion by the battery and any resistance in the circuit acting to impede that motion. So do try to avoid any discussion of QuoteThis{the} current moving from place of place, or splitting.
