StepHeader{Happens}

Quieter question commentary: All three are possible reasons as all lead to less vibration at your eardrum.

Fish question commentary: Sound does travel through water and spreads out from the source, rather than continuing in a well defined beam. More vibration would just mean the noise is louder, not affecting what it travels through.

Boy band question commentary: Sounds of all frequencies and amplitudes travel at the same speed. That the sounds produced by the band remain synchronised everywhere in the stadium is good evidence for this.

Squeaky question commentary: From the description, frequency, pitch, loudness and amplitude have all increased.
