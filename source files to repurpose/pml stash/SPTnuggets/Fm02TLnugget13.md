WebTitle{Patterns of thinking(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{Exploiting patterns whilst making them explicit}

TeacherTip{Three patterns of thinking have been widespread and explicit in the topic and throughout SPT. These are compensation, proportion, and accumulation. All three are used in this SPT: Force and motion topic. We suggest that you explicitly refer to the patterns in order to help show how common patterns of thinking are re-used in the topic.}

TeacherTip{Compensation: a trade-off between the physical quantities QuantitySymbol{x} and QuantitySymbol{y}, both of which contribute to the quantity QuantitySymbol{z}.}

ProductQuantityABC{z}{y}{x}

TeacherTip{Proportion: the physical quantities QuantitySymbol{x} and QuantitySymbol{y} go up and down together, and when one is zero, so is the other.}

ProductABC{QuantitySymbol{x}}{constant}{QuantitySymbol{y}}

TeacherTip{Accumulation: one physical quantity, QuantitySymbol{y} sets how another, QuantitySymbol{x}, grows over time.}

ProductQuantityABC{ SymbolDelta x}{y}{ SymbolDelta t}
