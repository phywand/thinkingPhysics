WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- Building explicit connections between the actions of animate and inanimate environments on an object
- Being consistent in the drawing of force arrows
- Giving children a variety of representations to hand when asking for descriptions
- Arranging it so that the placing of arrows is provisional and open to debate
- Focusing on the physical reasons for expecting a force to be acting SymbolEndash e.g. the bombardment by particles
- Acting as if Newton's first law really is hard to believe
- Speaking, acting and drawing with exemplary precision, so children can apprentice their practice on yours
- Using a rich variety of examples
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- Relying too much on precise words by themselves
- Acting as if the placing of arrows is obvious and open to a simple inspection
- Referring to forces cancelling out
- Using complex objects on which forces might be acting (with internally moving parts SymbolEndash bicycles, cars, people.)

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
