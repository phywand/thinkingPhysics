For some students the idea that the process of radioactive decay can be both a random process and one subject to fixed chance may seem strange.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Experience shows that it is really helpful to model radioactive decay by using a simple dice simulation. In one form of the activity, each student in the class is given 20 dice (radioactive atoms) and all students shake and roll their dice together. A QuoteThis{six} is taken to indicate the disintegration of an atom and each time a six appears that dice is removed. The remaining QuoteThis{stockpile} of radioactive dice, summed after each throw across all students, follows an exponential decay curve. This activity clearly models the random nature of the event (it's not possible to predict which dice will disintegrate next) along with the underlying fixed chance (one in six) of decay.

We'd suggest emphasising that it's a constant fraction that decay SymbolEndash here one-sixth. This constant-fractional-decay is the key idea.
