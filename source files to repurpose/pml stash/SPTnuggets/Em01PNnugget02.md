Although the simple classification of magnetic and non-magnetic materials set out above is quite adequate for physics 11&ndash;14, you might bear in mind that all materials are magnetic in that they are affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by a magnetic field.

For example, there are dramatic demonstrations showing that a jar of oxygen can be made to move using a powerful magnetic force, and it is possible to levitate water using a strong magnet.
