StepHeader{Happens}

Place the apparatus in a favourable light, where it can be clearly seen. Make sure there is a plain white backdrop. Describe the apparatus, showing the linked pair of chimneys with the candle placed under one.

Ask what will happen to the air in the chimney with the candle when the candle is lit. Make sure you challenge any suggestions that QuoteThis{heat rises}. Then ask what will happen to the remainder of the air in the apparatus. Try to build a clear expectation of what will happen before carrying out the demonstration. Light the candle SymbolEndash no air movement is seen. Introduce the smoke as a QuoteThis{tracer} above the empty chimney by pouring it down the smouldering straw with the unlit end held just above the chimney, but lower than the lit end. The smoke will follow the air down this chimney and up the other one.
