This episode takes us into the realms of practical devices such as motors, transformers and generators. How can the working of these devices be described and explained in terms of energy, energy in stores and power in pathways?

Electrical working shifts energy at a particular rate, thereby depleting stores.

Magnetic fields introduce their own challenges, of action at a distance, which is dealt with in the SPT: Forces topic. The interaction of magnetic fields with electric fields and currents sets more challenges, also detailed here.
