StepHeader{Increasing the power in a pathway SymbolEndash resistance is added in parallel to a simple circuit loop}

WrongTrack{When the resistor is added in parallel, there is more resistance, so energy will be shifted from the cell more slowly.}

RightLines{When the resistor is added in parallel, an extra current loop is provided and energy is shifted from the cell at a greater rate.}

As with the previous challenge, using physical quantities offers a direct way to sort out an answer. So, you might invent some figures along the following lines:

TeacherSpeak{Suppose we say that the cell is a ValueUnit{6}{volt} supply and that the resistor has a resistance of ValueUnit{12}{ohm}.}

TeacherSpeak{We can then work out the current in the loop using FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}, in this case FractionBlock{6 volt}{12 ohm}, so the current works out at ValueUnit{0.5}{A}.}

TeacherSpeak{So, ValueUnit{6}{joule} for each coulomb, ValueUnit{0.5}{coulomb} arriving each second, this predicts that ValueUnit{3}{joule} of energy is shifted in the resistor each second}

TeacherSpeak{OK, what happens when we add a second resistor in parallel?}

TeacherSpeak{ValueUnit{6}{volt} is the potential difference across each resistor.}

TeacherSpeak{Nothing has changed from the original circuit. The current through each resistor is:FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}, in this case FractionBlock{6 volt}{12 ohm}, so the current works out at ValueUnit{0.5}{A}.}

As a result, ValueUnit{3}{joule} of energy is shifted in each resistor per second.

TeacherSpeak{Alternatively we can say that if each of the two bulbs is shifting energy at the rate of  ValueUnit{3}{joule inverse second}, then the store associated with the cell must be emptying at the rate of  ValueUnit{6}{joule inverse second}.}

TeacherSpeak{So, adding an equal resistor in parallel doubles the rate at which the cell's store of energy is depleted.}

The physical picture to leave the students with is one of there being a circulation of charge through each of the two parallel loops. The flow of charge through the cell is doubled and therefore the rate at which energy is shifted is increased.
