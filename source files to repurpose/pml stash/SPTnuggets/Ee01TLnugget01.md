ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- draw out the ideas that students use to make predictions
- separate ideas of current and voltage, met previously
- connect calculations done to ideas used to account for the circuits
- reinforce the difference between series and parallel connections in circuits
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- emphasise the necessity of representing the complete loop as a connected system
- link the phenomena to the toolkits that you use to make predictions
- make the tookits evidently intelligible and fruitful
- use teaching models systematically
- give physical reasons for changes in current as the circuit is altered

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
