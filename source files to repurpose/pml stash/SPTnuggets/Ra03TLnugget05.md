There is a long tradition of starting with water waves when teaching about waves and radiation in physics. This makes a lot of sense because, unlike with light and sound, it is possible actually to see the water waves being reflected, refracted, diffracted and interfering.

In addition, the QuoteThis{first hand nature} of water waves is a good starting point for explaining interference effects with:
ListInformation
- Constructive interference leading to the creation of double-sized water waves
- Destructive interference leading to QuoteThis{flat water}
ListInformationEnd

It would be worth checking to see whether your school has a ripple tank that can be used to demonstrate all of these effects.

TeacherTip{You'll need to practice, and to pay particular attention to the setting up instructions SymbolEndash getting the depth of the water correct is often crucial.}
