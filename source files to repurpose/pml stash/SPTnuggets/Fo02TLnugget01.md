- convince children that inanimate things can push, just like they can
- develop the idea that a mechanism underpins the interaction that is replaced by force
- convince children that air can exert forces

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- relate floating and sinking to forces, not to rules about displaced fluids
- relate QuoteThis{friction} to the mechanisms of friction
- focus on the physical reasons for placing arrows
- justify omitting arrows from some diagrams

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
