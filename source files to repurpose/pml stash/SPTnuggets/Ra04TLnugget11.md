It is quite common to see statements along the lines of QuoteThis{alpha particles are more ionising than beta}, but this is not actually the case if both kinds of particle start with the same energy.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

The point to stress here is that the alpha radiation causes ionisation over a shorter path, creating a higher density of ionising collisions than beta radiation.
