WebTitle{Power: how rapidly can you shift energy?(Exposition)}

StepHeader{Energy, power and time}

The amount of energy that is shifted to or from a store during one second is called the power. The unit of power is the watt (W).

Suppose a light bulb has a power of  ValueUnit{100}{watt}. As a consequence, when the bulb is operating under normal conditions, it shifts  ValueUnit{100}{joule} of energy each second from the chemical store of the supply to the internal store of the surroundings (along heating and lighting pathways).

If you know the power output for a device such as an electric bulb, you can calculate the energy shifted in a given time as follows:

ProductABC{energy}{power}{duration}

FractionAdBeqCDdEF{energy}{joule}{power}{watt}{duration}{second}

And, expressed using symbols:

ProductQuantityABC{E}{P}{t}

Here is an example where energy is shifted to a kinetic store by accelerating a pellet.

There is a trade-off. You can have a big power for a short time, or a smaller power for a longer time. In both cases the same mass achieves the same top speed, and the same amount of energy is shifted into the kinetic store.
