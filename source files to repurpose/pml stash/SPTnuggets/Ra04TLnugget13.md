WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- dealing with the properties of ionising radiations before exploring their sources
- linking the behaviour of nuclear radiations to the behaviour of radiations from other sources
- exploiting the photon model to make the link between ionising and non-ionising radiations
- using the introduction of detectors as an opportunity to reinforce the process of ionising
- relating half-thickness and half-life
- comparing risks from ionising radiations to risks from other sources

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- treating ionising radiation as a completely isolated phenomenon
- getting bogged down in the different measures of ionising radiations
- not challenging QuoteThis{gut-reaction} reponses

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
