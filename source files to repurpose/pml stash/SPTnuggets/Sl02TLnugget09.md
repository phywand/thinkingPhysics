WebTitle{Separating loud/quiet (loudness) from high/low (pitch)(Challenge)}

StepHeader{Frequency and pitch}

WrongTrack{There are more vibrations, so it will be louder.}

RightLines{There are more vibrations each second, so the frequency will be higher, giving a higher pitched sound.}

StepHeader{Amplitude and loudness}

WrongTrack{With bigger vibrations it will be a higher sound.}

RightLines{If the amplitude of the vibration of the source is bigger, the sound produced will be louder.}

StepHeader{Describing sound}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

The central learning challenge for children is for them to develop a clear understanding of the difference between describing sounds in terms of loudness (amplitude) and pitch (frequency).
There are two separate ways of describing sounds here, and the aim must be to help children differentiate between them.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Using terms such as QuoteThis{more vibrations} or QuoteThis{it vibrates more} is likely to lead to confusion among your children. Be clear in specifying either.

more vibrations in a second (pitch or frequency)

or

each vibration involves a greater to-and-fro movement of the source, or of the air (loudness or amplitude)
