ThinkHeader{Ideas to emphasise here}

ListInformation
- construct the source-medium-detector model
- show illumination as a process where something travels
- build a helpful model of how illumination diminishes
- emphasise that there is a finite trip time from source to detector
- draw out the role of light in enabling seeing
- bring to mind the role of reflection in seeing luminous objects
- always explicitly accounting for reductions in brightness
- the physical aspect of the transmission of light
- light is emitted by luminous objects
- light travels in straight lines
- objects are transparent, translucent or opaque
- objects that are opaque cast shadows
- we only see non-luminous objects when light bounces off them
- sometimes, if the object is shiny, this bouncing can form an image (mirrors)
- light is detected by our eyes
- light travelling is the spreading of the vibrations
- link reductions in intensity with distance from the source
- link delays in hearing sounds compared to seeing sights to the trip time of propagation from the source
- that light travels through a vacuum (from the Sun and other stars)

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Strategies for supporting learning}

ListInformation
- identify source and detector
- separate luminous from non-luminous
- draw out children&apos;s ideas about seeing
- connect seeing to the source-medium-detector model
- build an explicit model of seeing
- organise what children have observed into a coherent whole
- build three-dimension models where illumination is important
- draw out what children believe about the Earth-Moon-Sun system and how this is related to everyday phenomena
- avoid restricting the idea of reflection to shiny surfaces
- reinforce the role of reflection in seeing
- connect seeing to both specular and diffuse reflections
- show clear examples of the phenomena
- introduce a wide range of surfaces from which reflection happens
- put the sourceâ€“medium-detector model to use; note the lack of tangible medium
- connect light sources (luminous objects) to how we detect them
- connect seeing to the source-medium-detector model
- separate the luminous object that generates the vibration from the propagation of the vibration, which is also a movement
- emphasising that all lights have a source
- emphasising that we only see non-luminous objects when light bounces off them
- tracing the chain from source to detector, via object, often
- connect human vision to what other species can see (for example snakes can see in IR and insects in UV)
- link each light seen back to the source, via the object it bounces off
- Look at different early models of seeing to see which ones fit the evidence of our experiments.

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children&apos;s ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- speaking or acting as if light was just there
- assuming that how we see is well understood
- assuming that seeing is all accounted for by the physics
- conflating rays (the theoretical construct) with light beams (the physical)
- running together what is noticed and recorded with what is modelled
- restricting examples of reflection to only, or mostly, shiny surfaces
- replacing experiences of real and interesting phenomena with a series of ad-hoc memorised rules
- not showing how an understanding of simple situations is linked to a wide variety of phenomena in the lived-in world
- introducing the technical term QuoteThis{ray}
- using specious energy descriptions
- drawing or showing transverse waveforms
- asserting that light is a wave without clarifying explanation of the idea of a wave SymbolEndash this is hard
- introducing wavelength, frequency, or energy of light

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
