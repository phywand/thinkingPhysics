ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- draw on everyday conversations about energy
- build on concerns about energy supply
- formalising the discourse about energy by connecting it to calculations
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- access values for energy
- emphasise the atemporal facet of energy: it's always stored
- distinguish between the physical descriptions of the lived-in world and the descriptions using the idea of energy
- build in the conservation of energy as an assumption in analysis

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
