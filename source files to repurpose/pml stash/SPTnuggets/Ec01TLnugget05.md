 Absolute distinctions make the clear categorisation, but may store up difficulties for the future. If children happen to test themselves as a material to go into circuit they will  notice that the bulb does not light up and therefore conclude that what they are made of is an insulator.  this decision would not serve them well if they were later to come into contact with a live wire in the home, connected to the mains supply. Conductor versus insulator is not a hard and fast category.

 Materials which we call QuoteThis{insulators}  to conduct electricity much more poorly than materials which we call QuoteThis{conductors}. However it is not the case that  insulators absolutely do not conduct electricity:  they might only allow very small  electrical current in exchange for a very large battery. So what might be thought of as an initial later when tested with a small battery could turn out to be a conductor when tested with a much larger battery.
