ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

For many learners air is seen as nothing. Comparing the mass of air in a small domestic room to the mass of a child might help to undermine this distinction (both can be ValueUnit{40}{kg}).

It is invisible: this again suggests that it doesn&apos;t really amount to much, if anything. It certainly is not the same sort of thing as a car engine, which we can rather easily imagine exerting a force.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

There are many cases where we need air to QuoteThis{get in the way}. Parachutes rely on air colliding with the large area of the canopy. Wind generators move because air exerts a force on the blades. Sail boats depend on a force from moving air. Although air does have a low density, if we can bump into enough of it (via a large area like a sail) and if the air is moving fast enough it will exert a considerable force. The moving air is not in itself a force. The air doesn&apos;t carry a force simply by moving. However, when the air collides with a surface, both the air and the surface experience a force. A force from the surface acts on the air to slow it down. There is a force in the opposite direction acting on the surface. It is this force on the surface which drives the sail boat through the water.

Motion is relative. Air colliding with a surface happens when either the moving air hits the surface (e.g. a sail boat) or the moving surface hits the air (e.g. a parachute or a sprint cyclist).
