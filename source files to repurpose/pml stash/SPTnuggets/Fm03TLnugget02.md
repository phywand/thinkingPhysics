WrongTrack{That bus had lots of force: it had lots of energy before it hit the pillar.}

WrongTrack{Kinetic energy and momentum must be the same: both get bigger as you go faster.}

RightLines{There are two useful measures of the QuotationThis{quantity of motion} of an object. Neither of these is the force. These measures are the energy in the kinetic store and the momentum.}

This challenge arises from an imprecise use of specialist terms, and perhaps from too much reliance on language alone. There are quantities that are reduced when an object is brought to rest, but none of these is the QuoteThis{force}, as a moving object does not have QuoteThis{force}.

Momentum and energy are both reduced when the object is brought to rest. The motion will stop when the energy in the kinetic store is shifted elsewhere SymbolEndash for example, once the brakes have been applied (a thermal store is filled as the brakes and surrounding air are warmed). A free-wheeling vehicle will eventually stop once the frictional forces have shifted all the energy from the kinetic store. In describing such behaviour as QuoteThis{running out of force}, we can see pupils with almost the right idea but mixing the terms QuoteThis{force} and QuoteThis{energy}.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Elsewhere we've suggested ways of introducing forces that we think will help students identify them accurately (in the SPT: Forces topic). The key point is that they are a way of describing the interactions of the object with the environment. Both momentum and the energy in the kinetic store are properly attributes of the object (at least from a particular point of view), and so could increase or decrease as the object's motion changes. Of course, one is a scalar and one a vector SymbolEndash a distinction probably best made by drawing.

There are fundamental differences between  momentum and energy, but we'd suggest that it's far more profitable to focus on seeing how the ideas are used, as it's this experience-based skill that will bring students a good feel for the ideas.
