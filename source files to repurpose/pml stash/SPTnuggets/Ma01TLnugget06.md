If I apply a force to the end of a lever there are two measurements, both in metres, which I might pay attention to in describing the event:

ListInformation
- The length, QuantitySub{L}{1}, from the pivot to the line of action of the force
- The distance, QuantitySub{D}{1}, that the force moves as the lever pivots
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Keep the lengths (QuantitySub{L}{1}, QuantitySub{L}{2}) from the pivot to the line of action of the forces  separate from the distances moved by those forces as the lever spins (QuantitySub{D}{1}, QuantitySub{D}{2}).}

This will help you think about either moments or energy.

To analyse the action of the lever in terms of moments:

ListInformation
- You'll need to consider the size of the force acting and the length from the line of action of the force to the pivot (QuantitySub{L}{1}).

To analyse the action of the lever in terms of energy:

ListInformation
- You'll need to consider the size of the force acting and the distance moved by that force (QuantitySub{D}{1}).
