ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- avoid confusing them with the detritus of history
- build connections between the macroscopic and the sub-microscopic
- develop a model of photons that is based on a wide range of phenomena
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- represent photons
- model frequency-dependent phenomena
- connect existing models of energy with shifting energy in chunks
- separate power in pathways from energy in stores
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
