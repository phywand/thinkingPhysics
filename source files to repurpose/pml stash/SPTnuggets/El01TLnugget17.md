StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- thinking about electrical loops
- emphasising the simultaneous movement of charge, everywhere in the loop
- using QuoteThis{model} to mean a toolkit for thinking with that is capable of generating predictions
- reasoning about electrical loops as complete systems
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- not challenging imprecise language, reasoning, diagramming
- using sequential models, such as donation models
- QuoteThis{electrical energy}
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
