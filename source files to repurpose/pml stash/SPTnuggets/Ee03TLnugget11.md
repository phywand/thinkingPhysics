WrongTrack{Electric generators are the opposite of electric motors. Instead of changing electricity into movement, they change movement into electricity.}

The wrong track thinking set out here takes us back to the world of QuoteThis{forms of energy}, where the working of a generator is described in terms of movement (or kinetic) energy being changed into electrical energy. Let's think about a simple hand-turned generator, running at a steady rate and connected to an electric bulb, in terms of energy being shifted along pathways.

The physical description is simple:

TeacherSpeak{I turn the handle and the bulb lights.}

The energy description:

TeacherSpeak{Energy is shifted from the chemical store associated with my body to the thermal stores of the surroundings.}

The power description:

TeacherSpeak{Power is switched from the mechanical working pathway to the electrical working pathway.}

Seen in these terms it's clear that the generator is a very useful device because of the way in which it switches the power from one pathway to another (from mechanical working to electrical working).
