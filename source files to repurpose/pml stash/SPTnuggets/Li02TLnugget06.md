StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- explicitly separating beams and rays
- being explicit about the modelling process
- exemplifying the construction of ray diagrams
- using the ray model to make predictions
- explicitly choosing rays to draw
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- conflating rays and beams
- conflating the lived-in world with the theoretical world of physics
- sketching ray diagrams
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
