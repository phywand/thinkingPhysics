StepHeader{Happens}

Groups of three working around a screen are best. You could, of course, just print out the completed instances.

There are some further examples here:

InsertLinkTA{A rocket in the ground}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/show.html?file=http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/NuggetsThreadsFiles/MfRocketInGroundDIPSupport.pde}


InsertLinkTA{A broken tree trunk}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/show.html?file=http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/NuggetsThreadsFiles/MfTreeTrunkBrokenDIPSupport.pde}


InsertLinkTA{A car on the drive}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/show.html?file=http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/NuggetsThreadsFiles/MfCarOnDriveDIPSupport.pde}


InsertLinkTA{A thrown object}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/show.html?file=http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/NuggetsThreadsFiles/MfParabolaForcesDIPSupport.pde}

You could, of course, prepare your own, by adapting this:

InsertCMR{MfBuildYourOwnDIPSupportCMRS}

You can get started here:

InsertLinkTA{Build your own}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/cmrEditor/editor.html?file=http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CMR/NuggetsThreadsFiles/MfBuildYourOwnDIPSupport.pde&filename=myDIP}


Faster groups, or those revisiting the topic for revision, could be invited to make up their own examples using the tool.
