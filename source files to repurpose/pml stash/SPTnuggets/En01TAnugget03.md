StepHeader{The energy costs of travel}

StepHeader{Purpose}

To establish that energy is measured in joules and that some kinds of travel are more expensive than others.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a diary of a week's travel activity for a pupil, showing the number of kilometres travelled by each mode of transport.

StepHeader{Happens}

This activity could usefully be carried out with spreadsheets, using technology to help keep track of the calculations.

Draw up a table of the number of kilometres for each mode of travel and use this to find out how many joules have been expended for each one:

StartTable
TableHeader{energy cost for one person to travel one km}{kilojoule}
TableRow{bicycle}{65 }
TableRow{walking}{232 }
TableRow{running}{287 }
TableRow{moped}{371 }
TableRow{car (1 person SymbolEndash 30 mph)}{2264 }
TableRow{car (5 people SymbolEndash 30 mph)}{506 }
TableRow{car (1 person SymbolEndash 60 mph)}{3444 }
TableRow{car (5 people SymbolEndash 60 mph)}{767 }
TableRow{train}{470 }
StopTable

Look for common patterns and differences among the pupils. You could make this into something of an exercise in the analysis of data: what hypotheses might explain the patterns?

Again, draw special attention to the way in which the common currency allows pupils to compare very different modes of transport.
