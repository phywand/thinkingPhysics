ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- draw on learners experience of, and ideas about, their own actions and relate these to force
- explore and expose children's ideas about forces
- draw out children's everyday ideas about motion and the forces required
- introduce children to a new way of seeingâ€”with forces
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- connect interactions between objects with the idea of a force
- represent objects simply, particularly extended objects
- adopt consistent conventions about where the arrows are drawn
- develop a consistent graphical language for your arrows, representing a force ontology
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
