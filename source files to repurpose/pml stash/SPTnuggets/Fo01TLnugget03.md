An OHP transparency or a well crafted computer-displayed slide can be used to show how the forces might be drawn on such a diagram. One technique is to cut out mini-force arrows made from card and add them onto an OHT, moving them about as directed by pupils.

We hope you'll use this to draw together pupils' work on placing arrows.
