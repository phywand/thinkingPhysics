This a part of a suggested sequence:

StepHeader{Purpose}

A widespread activity in secondary schools is to make a rough measurement of the speed of sound by timing the gap between making a sound and hearing an echo from a wall at a measured distance.

This activity takes things the other way around by assuming the speed of sound (ValueUnit{340}{metre / second}), measuring the time the sound takes and using this information to find the distance that the sound travelled.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a sonic ruler (These are available from many hardware stores. When working it should emit an audible click and then report the distance to the object you pointed it at.)
- an outside wall, about ValueUnit{150}{metre} away from where the children can stand
- a stopwatch, accurate to ValueUnit{0.01}{second}
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Start with the sonic ruler and ask if anybody knows how it works. Point out that it seems to be able to measure how far away an object is, simply by bouncing a sound off it. Ask how this is possible. The ruler actually measures the time that a sound pulse takes to travel to and from the object, then finds the distance by multiplying half the round-trip time (out and back) by the speed that it has it has stored in its memory.

This speed will be 340 metres in each second, so the distance will just be the number of seconds multiplied by this speed.

The next activity takes the class outside. The challenge is for the children to find their distance from the wall using the known speed of sound (ValueUnit{340}{metre / second}) and half the round trip time that they measure. Different groups of children will need varying amounts of help in carrying out this activity:

ListInformation
- Stand about ValueUnit{150}{metre} in front of the wall.
- Make a loud sound (maybe clapping two blocks of wood together).
- Time how long it takes to hear the echo from the wall.
- Calculate the distance.

It&apos;s good fun to run this activity as a competition. It is also a good place to think about the possible uncertainties in this experiment SymbolEndash beware of those who get suspiciously close to the QuoteThis{correct result}. How reliable are they as witnesses? This can lead to lively discussion.

This activity offers the opportunity to make connections to the technique of remote sensing. For example, ultrasonic imaging of pre-natal lambs (and Human babies) are done in exactly the same way. Times are measured for ultrasound pulses to travel to and from the foetus, then distances of the surface from the probe are calculated.

It would be good to have a number of impressive images, developed by remote sensing, to hand.
