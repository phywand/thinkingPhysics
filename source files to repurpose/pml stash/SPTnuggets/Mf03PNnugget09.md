You can demonstrate the effect of an electric force by rubbing a party balloon on your jumper and sticking it to a wall. The balloon is pulled towards the wall before it comes into contact with it. If the balloon is rubbed and held over some small pieces of paper (without touching them) they will be attracted to the balloon.

This force is often called an electrostatic force or a force due to static electricity.

The force arises because tiny electrically charged particles called electrons are transferred through the rubbing action SymbolEndash from the balloon to the jumper or paper and vice versa. These are the same charged particles (or charges) that constitute the electric current in a wire. However, because the materials do not conduct electricity, the electrons are unable to move around and are therefore QuoteThis{stuck} on the balloon or the sweater (hence the term static electricity). As with magnetic and gravitational forces, scientists describe the space around the balloon as containing an electric field. The electric field is set up by the charges on the balloon and shows the space throughout which it is able to exert an electrical force. An electrical force will act on each bit of paper located in this electric field.
