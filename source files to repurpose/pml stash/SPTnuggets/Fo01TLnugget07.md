WebTitle{Talking about stationary objects(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{No resultant force}

When talking about stationary objects it is a good idea to refer to there being

TeacherSpeak{&hellip; no resultant force&hellip;}

or even

TeacherSpeak{&hellip; there are several forces acting on the object but they added up to nothing &hellip;  we'll say that the resultant is zero.}

We think it's best to avoid saying:

TeacherSpeak{The forces have cancelled out.}

As forces are still actually there, present in the model. And they have to be, as their presence is as a result of the interactions of the object with its environment in the physical world.
