WebTitle{Model precise terminology(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{Electricity is not a word to use often}

In everyday speech the word QuoteThis{electricity} is very commonly used. Thus you might overhear statements such as:

QuoteThis{it runs off electricity},
and
QuoteThis{we need to pay the electricity bill}.

This sort of expression inevitably carries over into school and so pupils might say:

PupilSpeak{Emma}{Electricity flows round the circuit.}

Here you should encourage the pupils to be more precise in their use of terms: QuoteThis{What do you mean when you say that electricity flows? What is it that actually moves round the circuit?}

You should also model the careful use of language (as well as other expressive media), to encourage accurate and precise thinking.

TeacherSpeak{That's right! The charge moves round the circuit: that is an electric current.}

TeacherTip{There aren't many situations where simply banning the use of a particular word is likely to help pupils come to understand and be able to use new physics ideas&hellip;  but this might be one of those situations! A teaching colleague reckons that the only time he allows his pupils to use the word QuoteThis{electricity} is in writing the title in their books at the start of the new topic!}
