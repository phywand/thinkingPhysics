There are two types of connections: series and parallel. If there are parallel connections there is always more than one loop (as shown in one circuit here). In this topic you&apos;ll deal only with series connections, so with a single loop. Children are expected to develop a more sophisticated model of electrical loops, including parallel loops, somewhat later on.

ListInformation
- In the first step an extra battery is added to the circuit. This is compared to the simple circuit studied up to this point.
- Then, this same simple circuit is compared to one where there are two bulbs in a single loop.
