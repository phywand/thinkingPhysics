RightLines{The parent pushes on the pram making it speed up, or accelerate. As a result energy is shifted to the kinetic store of the pram, but it is the force that actually makes the pram speed up.}

You might come across statements such as these:


ListInformation
- Without energy nothing can ever happen.
- You need energy to move and to do jobs. 
- Energy is needed to get jobs done, or to make things work.
- A bike keeps moving because it has energy in its kinetic store.

Such statements cast energy as the cause of processes and reflect an everyday way of thinking about energy. However, from a scientific point of view, this is not correct. Energy does not make things happen. You can be sure of this because energy is conserved: the energy before a process is the same as energy afterwards. If the amount of energy does not change how can it make anything happen?

So try to avoid statements like those above in your own teaching. It is better to use other ideas (such as force) to explain why things happen. Using energy can sometimes explain why some processes cannot happen, and give other insights, but it cannot be rightly considered a cause.
