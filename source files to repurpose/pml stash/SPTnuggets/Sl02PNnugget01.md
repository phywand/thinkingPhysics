I was working at my desk in the attic when I became distracted by the radio playing downstairs in the living room. It was a news programme and as I started to pay attention I realised that I could clearly hear every single word. Not surprising in some ways&hellip;but then again the sound was starting from the speaker down on the living room floor and reaching me at the top of the house. The sound was travelling up the stairs, back along the landing and then up along another set of stairs to the attic. Not only could I hear the news in the living room and attic, I could hear it all over the house and outside as well.

In day-to-day living we are surrounded by all kinds of different sounds. Just stop and listen. Some of these, such as the noise from traffic or the sound of people talking or the radio playing are just there and we often don&apos;t even notice them. Of course, sounds don&apos;t just exist as a kind of backdrop to our lives. They also provide us with information. For example, you quickly learn to recognise, by the sounds, when bacon is cooking too quickly, when the kettle is coming to the boil or when the car is misfiring.
