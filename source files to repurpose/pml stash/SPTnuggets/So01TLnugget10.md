StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- make explicit use of the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model
- model the vibrations as changes in density
- link the movements of the sources to changes in density
- keep the language simple: 'to and fro' may be more effective than 'longitudinal'
- relating what's pictured as a part of the model to human experiences
- draw simple sketches, rather than hanging too much on words

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- using specious energy descriptions
- drawing or showing transverse waveforms
- asserting that sound is a wave without clarifying explanation of the idea of a wave
- conflating models with the lived-in world

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
