Noticing where something is (its position) and when it's there (what the time on the clock is) are both QuoteThis{right-now} recordings of data.

So where something is and when it is there are both QuoteThis{at an instant}.

A record of a journey is a set of these pairs (VectorOver{d}, clock time). These pairs are often referred to as QuoteThis{events}. A multiple exposure picture is a good depiction of such a sequence. Less valuable, but more accessible are successive frames on a movie clip of the motion.

You record a position and an instant to fix an event. A series of such recordings narrates the journey, as has become popular on websites where you're encouraged to share such stories by uploading your GPS tracks (which are just such a series of recordings of events).
TeacherSpeak{Let's look again at this motion on the movie clip. How long does each frame last?}

PupilSpeak{Ed}{A very short time SymbolEndash it depends on the video camera.}

TeacherSpeak{What should we look for to get the best record?}

PupilSpeak{Belinda}{As short a time as possible.}

TeacherSpeak{Good: as close to zero as possible.}

TeacherSpeak{So when is the ball here [points]?}

PupilSpeak{Carly}{Just as the clock points to that time. Not before, not after.}

TeacherSpeak{That's very clear. It's at that instant, and only that instant. At that clock time the WordSub{position}{instantaneous} is QuoteThis{x}. And it's only there right then, because the ball keeps moving.}
