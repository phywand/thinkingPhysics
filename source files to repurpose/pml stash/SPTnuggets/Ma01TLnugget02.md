WrongTrack{That's brilliant! You get out more than you put in!}

RightLines{It's true that the force to lift the load on the lever is greater than the effort you make, but you must push through a bigger distance to make the load move a small amount. In this way the performance of the lever is limited by the law of conservation of energy.}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Many levers work as force-multipliers. In this case a small force (or effort) acting on the lever moves a large distance to produce a large force moving a smaller distance.

At first this might appear to be a case of QuoteThis{getting something for nothing}.

Other levers work as distance-multipliers. Here a large force acting on the lever moves a small distance to produce a small force moving a larger distance. This process of compensation for the increase in force or distance is central to the design of levers.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Here you need to draw attention to the QuoteThis{trade-offs} between force and distance. We're not dealing with QuoteThis{something for nothing}. You might make the point more formally by writing it out in the precise way shown below, so that every term is just a number:

FractionAdBeqCDdEF{energy shifted}{joule}{force}{newton}{distance}{metre}

You can also write (making notes to yourself about the units): ProductABC{energy shifted in joule}{force in newton}{distance in metre}

Or even express it rather concisely as: ProductABC{energy shifted}{force}{distance}
