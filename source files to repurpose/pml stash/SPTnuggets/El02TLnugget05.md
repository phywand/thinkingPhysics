The idea that adding batteries increases the rate at which energy is being supplied to the circuit makes intuitive good sense to most pupils.

However you should avoid any temptation to suggest that the charged particles are QuoteThis{given} more energy. They are not. The rope loop is very useful here, as it correctly presents the idea that what is going on is a kind of remote working. The electrical loop links the shifting of energy from the chemical store of the battery to the shifting of energy to the thermal store of the surroundings as the bulbs glow and the radiating warms their environment.

The rope loop model is likely to be useful here in helping the pupils to picture what is going on:
