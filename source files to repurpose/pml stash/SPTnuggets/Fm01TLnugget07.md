TeacherTip{If some quantity is a vector, we'd suggest using an explicit notation to make that very clear. So we'd suggest VectorOver{x} instead of just writing the vector in a bold or italic face.}

So acceleration is shown to be a vector by writing VectorOver{a}.

And velocity is shown to be a vector by writing VectorOver{v}.

In this way you'll help to keep separate scalars and vectors in students' minds.

You'll also be using something that they can mimic, and so help clarify their own thinking, when expressing ideas for themselves.

TeacherTip{Vectors: acceleration, VectorOver{a}; velocity, VectorOver{v}; displacement, VectorOver{d} . <br> Scalars: speed; distance; mass.}
