There are three kinds of contact forces that can support an object.

Warp forces can be found wherever a solid is distorted by an object:

ListInformation
- Add a compression force exerted by a neighbouring solid acting on the object if that solid is compressed by the object.
- Add a tension force exerted by a neighbouring solid acting on the object if that solid is compressed by the object.

You might, for teaching purposes, combine these two and call them warp forces SymbolEndash with the forensic clue that if a solid in contact with the object is stretched or squeezed then you can add an arrow labelled warp force.

ListInformation
- Add a buoyancy force if the object is partially or wholly immersed in a fluid.
ListInformationEnd

Frictional forces of three kinds can be found at the surfaces of the object when it moves, or makes to move, past other particles in its environment.

ListInformation
- If the environmental particles are a solid and no movement occurs, add an arrow at the contacting surface and label it grip force.
- If the environmental particles are a solid and movement occurs, add an arrow at the contacting surface and label it slip force.
- If the environmental particles are a liquid and movement occurs, add an arrow at the most significant surface and label it drag force.
ListInformationEnd

You might, for teaching purposes, combine these three and call them frictional forces SymbolEndash but we'd not recommend that as it obscures the very different reasons for adding the arrows.
