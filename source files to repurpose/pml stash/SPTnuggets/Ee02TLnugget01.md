Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- avoid cluttering up learners with inappropriate ideas
- avoid unhelpful experiences
- avoid drowning in a sea of algebra or arithmetic
- keeping ideas of power, energy, charge and current separate
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- avoid using the unhelpful term QuoteThis{electrical energy}
- introduce the idea of continuing (electrical) working whilst the loop is complete
- distinguish clearly between energy in stores (joule) and power in pathways (watt)
- consistently model series and parallel connections

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
