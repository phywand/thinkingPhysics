StepHeader{Happens}

Choose three different sites around the school for the children to visit. Spend two or three minutes looking carefully to the different lights at that site. Discuss what you notice about the lights and make a record, either as a whole group or in small groups.

Here are some useful questions to help direct thinking:

TeacherSpeak{What lights can you see?}

TeacherSpeak{Do you think the lamps you&apos;re seeing are close to you or far away?}

TeacherSpeak{Can you give a reason why you think what you&apos;re seeing is close to you or far away from you?}

TeacherSpeak{Can you see what is making the light?}

TeacherSpeak{How do you think the light would change if you had seen it outdoors, say or in the classroom?}

TeacherTip{This activity can be repeated beyond the school grounds, perhaps also in the local area, or at home.  A portable light meter would be invaluable.}
