The connection between electric currents and magnetic fields was first demonstrated in 1820 by a Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted. Oersted showed that a compass needle (a small pivoted magnet) moves whenever an electric current passes through a nearby wire.

This simple demonstration can be replicated in the classroom to great effect, making the link from electricity to magnetism:

- Everyone knows that wires connected to batteries are QuoteThis{about electricity}.
- Everyone knows that compass needles are QuoteThis{about magnetism}.
- Switch on the electric current and the compass needle moves.
- You have witnessed, at first hand, the link between electricity and magnetism!
