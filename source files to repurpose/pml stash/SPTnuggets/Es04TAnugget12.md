StepHeader{Happens}

The story to tell here is that it is possible to produce a model that explains why the shape of the Moon changes. Constructing models and theories is an essential part of the work of the scientist. This model uses a large white football to represent the Moon and a torch beam to provide the QuoteThis{sunlight}.


ListInformation
- Stand a group of pupils in the middle of the room. Tell them that they are the QuoteThis{Earth}. Ask the other pupils to stand with you by the QuoteThis{Sun} (the torch).
- Put the QuoteThis{Moon} (the football) in position A. Ask the QuoteThis{Earth pupils} to tell the rest of the group how much of the Moon they can see.
- Repeat for positions B, C and D.
- Now ask the class to sketch what the QuoteThis{Earth pupils} will see when you put the Moon at positions E and F. Tell the QuoteThis{Earth pupils} to draw what they can see. Ask the pupils to compare their drawings.
- Spend some time resolving any differences. Put pupils who got it wrong in the middle and let them see for themselves.
ListInformationEnd

Ask the pupils to complete the support sheet QuoteThis{Explaining the phases of the Moon}. This requires them to think about the explanation that they have just seen.
