StepHeader{Happens}

Tell the pupils that scientists use all kinds of ways to represent what they know. Being good at science requires the ability to go between one form and another easily.

ListInformation
- Give out the support sheet and ask the pupils to produce an explanation on their own (5 minutes maximum).
- Now ask them to join with another pupil and compare explanations. Can they produce a joint explanation that is better than either one?
