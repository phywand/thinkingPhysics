StepHeader{Relating voltage, current and resistance}

Setting up a simple circuit consists of selecting two components SymbolEndash the battery and the bulb, and linking them with wires. The two choices you make set the QuoteThis{push}: the voltage of the battery, and how much that push is impeded: the resistance of the bulb. The current in the loop is the result of these two choices. Much more on this in the SPT: Electricity and energy topic.

The relationship between the push of the battery and the size of electric current is summarised by:

FractionABC{current}{voltage}{resistance}

You can write this out in symbols:

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}

Where QuantitySymbol{V} is voltage, measured in volt; QuantitySymbol{I} is current, measured in ampere; QuantitySymbol{R} is resistance, measured in ohm.

According to this relationship, if the resistance does not change, then increasing the voltage results in an increase in current.

Choosing a ValueUnit{3}{volt} battery and a ValueUnit{10}{ohm} resistor results in a current of ValueUnit{0.3}{ampere} in the resistor (and in the battery, and in the connecting wires).

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}

Put in the values to get:

FractionABC{current in loop}{ValueUnit{3}{volt}}{ValueUnit{10}{ohm}}

and work out the current as ValueUnit{0.3}{ampere}.

If the battery voltage is doubled to ValueUnit{6}{volt}, the new current is  still given by FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}, but you need to insert the new values
FractionABC{current in loop now}{ValueUnit{6}{volt}}{ValueUnit{10}{ohm}} and calulate the current as ValueUnit{0.6}{ampere}.

There is a ValueUnit{0.6}{ampere} current in each part of the circuit loop: in the lamp; in the battery; in both the connecting wires.

Double the battery voltage gives double the current.
