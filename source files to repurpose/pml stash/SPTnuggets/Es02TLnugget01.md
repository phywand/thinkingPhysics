ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- introduce the wide variety of objects that function as satellites
- draw out ideas of what a natural motion might be
- explore expectations about satellites falling back to Earth
- draw out any difficulties with the motion of satellites
- introduce a wide range of uses for artificial satellites
- include natural satellites alongside artificial satellites

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- account for circular motion
- explain the need for a centripetal force
- distinguish between orbiting and spinning on an axis
- draw diagrams to distinguish between geostationary and circumpolar orbits for satellites

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
