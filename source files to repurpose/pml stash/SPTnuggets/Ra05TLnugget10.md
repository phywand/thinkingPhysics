StepHeader{Highlighting a new form of change}

Radioactive decay may well be the first example that students meet of an exponential change. It is therefore important to draw attention to this new form of change:

TeacherSpeak{So, if we look at the activity curve for the radioactive source, what can we say about its shape?}

PupilSpeak{Abdul}{It goes down.}

TeacherSpeak{Yes, it goes down! How does it go down?}

PupilSpeak{Nicki}{Steeply at first and then more gently.}

TeacherSpeak{Exactly right! Who can explain this pattern? Think about the activity we did with the dice.}

PupilSpeak{Azul}{At first there are lots of radioactive atoms&hellip; so you are more likely to get a six!}

TeacherSpeak{Well, that's right. At first there are lots of unstable atoms, that decay with a fixed chance, and as time goes by the remaining stockpile of atoms gets smaller and so the rate of decay (or the number of sixes) gets smaller.}
