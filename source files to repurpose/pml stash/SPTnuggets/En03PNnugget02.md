Power stations are a feature of western society and often a topic of social, scientific and political debate. Few would voluntarily return to a situation where there is less energy at their disposal, yet equally few welcome new power stations in their own back yard. Current lifestyles demand the shifting of large quantities of energy from one store to another and in ways that inevitably result in the energy being dissipated. This makes the energy less easily available for future generations.

Here are the energy dissipation figures for the UK over the last few years.

This is a comparison of the use of energy resources in electricity generating power stations in the UK in 1990 and 2002. The most striking changes are the reduction in the amount of coal used and the accompanying increase in the consumption of gas.

Estimates of the energy resources that are available (that is, stores that can be depleted reasonably easily) vary depending on the technology at that time, and on recent geological exploration. Here are the UK figures for three resources over time.

The changing rates of energy resource usage are worth looking at. The UK government publishes a digest of all the energy figures every July, and these are made available on the gov.uk website.
