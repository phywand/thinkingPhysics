WebTitle{Different terms for the same thing(Expansion &ndash; tell me more)}

StepHeader{Confused? SymbolEndash try this}

Read this if you are confused about the use of many different terms.

QuoteThis{Voltage} and QuoteThis{potential difference} and QuoteThis{potential drop} and QuoteThis{p.d.}

Very often, the voltage across a circuit component, such as a bulb, is referred to as a potential difference (a p.d.).

TeacherSpeak{So, if I just take the reading of the voltmeter, it's ValueUnit{2.5}{volt}. The p.d. across the bulb is ValueUnit{2.5}{volt}.}

Sometimes you might hear people talk about the QuoteThis{voltage across the bulb}, at other times about the QuoteThis{potential difference across the bulb} and sometimes about the QuoteThis{potential drop} or QuoteThis{p.d.} On first hearing this, it can be confusing! However, the diagrams we use show that the voltage is a measure of the difference in QuoteThis{potential energy per coulomb} as charge passes through a circuit component. Hence the use of the terms potential difference or potential drop. At this stage is probably simpler for pupils just to use QuoteThis{voltage}.

There is more on the reasons to prefer thinking about potential difference later in this episode and much more in the SPT: Electricity and energy topic.
