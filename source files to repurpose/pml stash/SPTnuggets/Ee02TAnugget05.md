StepHeader{Purpose}

This demonstration allows you to compare:

ListInformation
- The brightness of two bulbs commonly used in the home by measuring this in lux at a set distance from each bulb.
- The relative effectiveness of the bulbs in shifting energy from the original chemical store (assuming fossil fuel power station) to the light pathway. Do this by dividing the lux reading at a set distance from the bulb by the power rating of the bulb to show the brightness per watt.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- 2 retort stands
- 3 bosses and clamps
- 1 metre ruler
- 1 digital light meter
- 2 mains energy meters
- 1 thick black card big enough to shield the lamp from the light meter
- 2 electrical lamp housings
- 1 incandescent bulb (most commonly used ValueUnit{60}{watt}) attached to one lamp
- 1 CFL (compact fluorescent lamp, most commonly used ValueUnit{20}{watt}) attached to other lamp (look for one which has QuoteThis{energy saving bulb} written on the bulb or on the packaging box)
- 1 original CFL packaging box

StepHeader{Happens}

This demonstration should be set up in a darkened corner of a room away from direct sunlight, with lights off and normal blinds pulled down if it's a sunny day. Black-out blinds could be employed, if available. The lamps should each be plugged in to a mains meter. Bear in mind that throughout this activity the CFL bulb will need to be on for 1 minute before taking a reading because the bulb does not reach maximum brightness immediately.

StepHeader{Comparing bulbs}

The following contains sample data. Your own values are likely to differ and should be used instead. Show the class the two bulbs (in their housings) being used and ask which of the students have each kind in their homes.

TeacherSpeak{Why do you think that over the last 10 years or so families have been encouraged to switch to these newer CFL bulbs?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{Well, I think it is because they last longer and because they use less energy.}

TeacherSpeak{These are good points. You'll notice on the side of the CFL bulb that the words QuotationThis{energy saving bulb} is printed. What do you think this means?}

(This will be printed on either the bulb or the packaging box.)

PupilSpeak{Alex}{This means that they use less energy.}

TeacherSpeak{What do you mean by QuotationThis{use less energy}? Doesn't this really depend on how long you leave the bulb on for?}

PupilSpeak{Alex}{Yes it does. I mean if you leave both on for the same time, then the CFL bulb will have used less energy.}

TeacherSpeak{So what quantity are you really talking about?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{Power. The CFL bulb shifts energy from one store to another at a lower rate.}

TeacherSpeak{Good. We can see this from the mains meters.}

Show the class that the meter reads approximately ValueUnit{60}{watt} (ValueUnit{57}{watt}, sample data) for the incandescent bulb and much less for the incandescent bulb (ValueUnit{16}{watt}, sample data).

TeacherSpeak{Also think about this statement QuotationThis{energy saving}. Can we really QuotationThis{save energy}? And what about Alex saying QuotationThis{using energy}?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{Energy is always conserved. I think what is really meant is that since the CFL bulb needs energy at a lower rate, then less fuel is burned in a power station. What is really being saved is the fuel!}

TeacherSpeak{That's much better. Now, if we're to be persuaded to use the CFL bulbs we need to know that they will give a sufficient amount of light. We'll compare their brightness using a light meter.}

StepHeader{Brightness and lux}

Show the class the meter and demonstrate how placing it near the bulb will give a reading in lux. There's no need to discuss what this unit represents; just accept that it's a useful way to compare the luminous brightness.

TeacherSpeak{We can compare the brightness if we compare the reading in lux on the meter. We do have a problem, however.}

PupilSpeak{Alex}{Even without the bulb, the light meter will give a reading. We need to take this away from the reading when the meter is put near the bulb.}

Place the light meter at the same distance from each bulb (ValueUnit{0.5}{metre}) ensuring that the meter is aligned with the centre of the bulb. Check the distance with the metre rule. Take a background light meter reading with the bulb shielded from the meter using the black card, then take the reading with the black card removed. The reading from the lamp will be the difference between the two.

It's worth writing these readings on the board: Incandescent bulb produces ValueUnit{408}{lux} at ValueUnit{0.5}{metre};  CFL bulb produces ValueUnit{192}{lux} at ValueUnit{0.5}{metre} .

TeacherSpeak{So what do our results show?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{That the incandescent bulb is better.}

TeacherSpeak{Better, but how is it better?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{The incandescent bulb is giving out more light.}

TeacherSpeak{That's true, so should we therefore use these bulbs instead of CFL bulbs? Do you think that the difference in brightness as read by the light meter would make a difference to how bright our rooms would be at home?}

PupilSpeak{John}{Well in my house we have both types of bulbs and all of our rooms are bright. I don't think it makes much of a difference really!}

TeacherSpeak{Don't forget that the incandescent bulb is also shifting more energy per second than the CFL bulb.}

StepHeader{Luminous output and electrical input}

Draw the students' attention again to the mains meters.

TeacherSpeak{Wouldn't we expect then that the incandescent would give more light since the meter reads a higher power?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{I suppose so.}

TeacherSpeak{I wonder if there is a way in which we could compare the brightness, or the amount of light given out by the bulbs, which also takes into account the amount of energy being shifted, or power?}

PupilSpeak{Alex}{I don't know!}

TeacherSpeak{Let me help you. The incandescent bulb shifts energy at a rate of ValueUnit{56}{watt} and the bulb gave a reading of ValueUnit{408}{lux} at ValueUnit{0.5}{metre} away. We could imagine that, for each ValueUnit{1}{watt}, ValueUnit{7.3}{lux} of light is measured (ValueUnit{408}{lux} / ValueUnit{56}{watt}). So the incandescent bulb gives ValueUnit{7.3}{lux} of light for each watt or JustUnit{joule second -1}. Now, what is the calculation for the CFL bulb?}

PupilSpeak{Alex}{For the CFL bulb the power read from the meter was ValueUnit{16}{watt} and ValueUnit{192}{lux} was recorded at ValueUnit{0.5}{metre}. So for each ValueUnit{1}{watt} the light meter recorded ValueUnit{12.0}{lux}}.

Focus attention on these values, perhaps by writing them down: the incandescent bulb produces ValueUnit{7.3}{lux inverse watt} ; the CFL produces  ValueUnit{12.0}{lux inverse watt}.

TeacherSpeak{Now which bulb would we consider to be better?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{It depends what you mean by better! If we mean which is better at switching power to the lighting pathway then the CFL bulb is better.}

TeacherSpeak{How many times better?}

PupilSpeak{Lydia}{1.6 times better!}

This activity might lead to a discussion about whether or not we're convinced that using a CFL bulb is better. They run at a lower power and are better at radiating. This is surely a strong argument in their favour.
