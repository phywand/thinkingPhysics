WrongTrack{If you heat up a radioactive source, such as radium, it will become more active and give out radiation at a greater rate. It's just the same as with heating up chemicals in chemical reactions.}

RightLines{Changing the temperature of a radioactive source has no effect on the activity of the source.}

The fundamental point to stress here is that external conditions, such as temperature and pressure, have no effect on the activity of a radioactive source. The spontaneous emission of radiation involves changes within the nucleus of each atom of the source. This is a different process from that involved in chemical changes where increasing the temperature results in increased motion of atoms, more frequent collisions and a consequent increased rate of reaction.
