StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- thinking about electrical loops
- linking what you do in setting up a loop to your reasoning about the circuit
- using QuoteThis{model} to mean a toolkit for thinking with that is capable of generating predictions
- reasoning about electrical loops as complete systems
- reasoning about parallel circuits as two complete loops
- being consistent in how you draw circuits

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- using sequential models, such as donation models
- conflating energy shifting and charge flowing
- QuoteThis{electrical energy}
