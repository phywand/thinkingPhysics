RightLines{Both magnetic and electric forces can attract and repel, but the the mechanisms to account for these interactions are different; in one case involving magnetic poles and in the other case involving electric charges.}

The basic problem here is that children confuse the charges story of electric forces with the poles story of magnetic forces. This is hardly surprising since QuoteThis{opposites attract and likes repel} is a common mantra of the science classroom.

The same pattern of attraction and repulsion is found both for magnets and for electric charges. Two QuoteThis{like} poles (two norths or two souths) repel each other, whilst opposite poles, a north near a south, attract. However, you should take care not to mix up attraction and repulsion between poles with attraction and repulsion between opposite or similar electric charges.

Here are some children working in this area:

Electric forces to be the result of the separation of positively and negatively charged particles. Magnets, on the other hand, are not charged. The force between magnets can be accounted for in terms of the effect of an alignment of the atoms within the magnet. Each atom might be considered to be a mini magnet. When these atoms line up together their combined effect is strong enough to reach out beyond their immediate location SymbolEndash the magnetic field, a QuoteThis{force field}, exists around the magnet.
