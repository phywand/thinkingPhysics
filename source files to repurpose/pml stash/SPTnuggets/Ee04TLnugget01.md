ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- bring calculations back to the lived-in word
- relate very abstracted descriptions to very practical concerns
- keep power and energy separate, yet related
- keep calculations linked to physical concerns, showing what cannot happen
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- deal with power as that which accumulates energy
- separate descriptions that link snapshot to snapshot from descriptions of processes
- construct explanations in careful, explicit steps
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
