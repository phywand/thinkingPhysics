StepHeader{Use terms interchangeably}

As these new ideas about voltage are first introduced, it is helpful if sometimes you refer to QuoteThis{volt} and sometimes QuoteThis{joule per coulomb}, or QuoteThis{volt} and sometimes QuoteThis{watt per ampere}. By using the terms interchangeably in this way, the underlying meaning of voltage is continually made explicit:

TeacherSpeak{OK, so the reading on the voltmeter is ValueUnit{1.4}{volt}, it's ValueUnit{1.4}{joule / coulomb}.}

TeacherSpeak{OK, so the reading on the voltmeter is ValueUnit{1.4}{volt}, it's ValueUnit{1.4}{watt / ampere}.}
