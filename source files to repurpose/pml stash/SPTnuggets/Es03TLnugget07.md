WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- explicitly modelling the scales of objects
- drawing attentions to the different scales used in representations
- engaging the imagination so that the very real difficulties in matching the phenomena to the models are evident
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- using diagrams where multiple scales are represented uncritically
- providing too much detailed history
- treating the different models as facts
- not separating what is observed from the explanations for those observations
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
