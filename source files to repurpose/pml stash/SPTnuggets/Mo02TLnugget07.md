WrongTrack{As things fall they must keep speeding up because gravity pulls them down.}

RightLines{On Earth, all falling objects move through the atmosphere. The resulting movement through the air creates a frictional force which acts against the motion. Objects reach a constant speed when the upward force equals the downward force of gravity.}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

The point here is for pupils to appreciate that objects speed up or accelerate as they fall under the influence of gravity, but also to recognise that they may achieve a constant terminal speed because of the effects of retarding forces.

Pupils know that you cannot take away or reduce the gravity force and therefore tend to assume that a falling object speeds up continuously. Furthermore, within the limits of pupil experience few falling objects reach a constant speed.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

To move pupils onto the right lines you might set up some laboratory demonstrations to illustrate terminal speed. These might include objects falling in a tall column of water or low density objects such as polystyrene balls in free-fall.
