ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- identify source and detector
- separate luminous from non-luminous
- draw out children's ideas about seeing
- connect seeing to the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model
- build an explicit model of seeing
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- construct the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model
- show illumination as a process where something travels
- build a correct model of how illumination diminishes
- emphasise that there is a finite trip time from source to detector
- draw out the role of light in enabling seeing
- bring to mind the role of reflection in seeing luminous objects
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
