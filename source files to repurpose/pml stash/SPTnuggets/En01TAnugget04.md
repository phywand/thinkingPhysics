StepHeader{Comparing lamps}

StepHeader{Purpose}

To establish that individual choices can make a difference.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- two mains lamps of equal brightness, one energy saver (compact fluorescent) and one filament, say ValueUnit{100}{watt}, complete with their packaging
- this interactive InsertLink{EnLightbulbsFILE}

StepHeader{Happens}

Compare the brightness of the two lamps. They should provide equal illumination, but the conventional filament lamp will cost more energy per second to run (about four times as much typically). Now compare how warm they feel by holding the hand a short distance away.

StepHeader{Making savings}

Work out with the class how many such lamps they have in their homes. What savings could be achieved if they all swapped? Now work it out for the whole school. This will be a very good practice of estimating SymbolEndash always work to one significant figure only! How many people have to change so that we can shut down one ValueUnit{100}{MW} power station? Perhaps we could avoid all the arguments about wind turbines in remote areas of natural beauty if we all demanded a bit less energy.

Lamps are easy to compare as most homes are lit using electrical power. Whilst it would be very useful to compare lighting with heating, it'll only be a minority of homes that are QuoteThis{all-electric}, and so such comparisons are harder to do without much more conversion work. However, if your class can cope with the numbers and arithmetic, this is well worthwhile, if only to convince them that QuoteThis{turning a light off to save energy} is not the most effective of actions.
