ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Pupils need to differentiate between the speed of sound in air (about ValueUnit{340}{metre / second}) and the speed of light in air (about ValueExponent{3}{8}{metre / second}).

TeacherTip{Introduce everyday examples to emphasise that sound and light travel at different speeds.}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Many pupils are familiar with the situations that can be referred to in drawing attention to the difference between the speeds of sound and light. For example, they may know that you can see a flash of lightening before you hear the peal of thunder. They may not, however, be clear about how this observation can be accounted for.

We see the flash virtually instantaneously because light travels so fast. Sound, on the other hand, travels more slowly (about ValueUnit{300}{metre / second}). If the storm is one mile away SymbolEndash about ValueUnit{1500}{m} SymbolEndash the sound will take about ValueUnit{5}{s} to arrive.

Other situations that you might talk about with pupils include:

Sprinters start on the flash of a gun, rather than the bang. On school sports day, the starter actually stands half way down the ValueUnit{100}{m} track with the starting pistol. How long will it take for the bang to arrive? (About ValueUnit{0.3}{s}).
