StepHeader{Purpose}

To introduce the idea of finding the magnetic north pole from anywhere on the Earth.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a strong bar magnet, suspended in a sling, so that it is free to pivot
- a walker&apos;s compass
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Hang the magnet in a sling, taking care not to have any magnetic materials nearby that it might be attracted to. Point to the XxxxVille (pick a town just north of you) seeking pole. Mark it.

Ask what would happen if you went further north up this island. You&apos;d still be pointing to a XxxxVille-seeking pole! You can use this continuing tendency to point to things north of you to introduce the idea of north-seeking pole. This is usually contracted to the QuoteThis{north pole} of the magnet SymbolEndash really meaning the QuoteThis{north-seeking pole}.

Show the walker&apos;s compass, asking how you know where north is using such a compass.
