This is held as being so obvious that most people wouldn't even bother to check it out. A heavy block of wood, mass ValueUnit{2}{kilogram}, is clearly being pulled down with a greater force of gravity (about ValueUnit{20}{newton}) than a lighter piece of wood, mass ValueUnit{1}{kilogram} (about ValueUnit{10}{newton}). It seems clear to most that this larger force will make the heavy object fall faster.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

The fact that a larger block of wood is subject to a greater force from gravity is indeed true. However, the greater mass of this wood requires a greater force to maintain its accelerated motion. Overall, the effect of a small force on a small mass is the same as that of a large force on a large mass. The net effect is the same SymbolEndash they fall together. They have the same force to mass ratio. (There is more on this argument in the Gravity and Space episode in the SPT: Earth in space topic.) The most important strategy for teaching is to set up a simple and effective QuoteThis{dropping objects} practical activity. Pupils should drop the objects themselves and also watch objects dropped by others. It is important to use objects that will not damage the floor or feet.
