StepHeader{Purpose}

Here pupils make some measurements of frictional force, and investigate the factors affecting that force.

StepHeader{Prepare}

Per group:

ListEquipment
- a newtonmeter
- several shoes SymbolEndash pupils might be encouraged to bring in their own
- several one kilogram masses
- a plank of wood and a means of supporting it at different angles
- copies of the support sheet

SafetyTip{Support planks properly. Avoid having planks on top of benches, where they may fall off.}

StepHeader{Happens}

There are two possible investigations:

ListInformation
- How much force is required to make a shoe slide?
- With the shoe on a slope, what angle of slope is needed to just make the shoe start to slide?
ListInformationEnd

For each, try to motivate exploration by relating the problem back to everyday concerns.

The two investigations can be carried out with very simple apparatus, as shown.
