StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- exemplifying seeing in the lived-in world using the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model
- emphasising the trip time as a delay between source and detector
- working up some convincing demonstrations that light seems to travel in straight lines
- always explicitly accounting for reductions in brightness
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- speaking or acting as if light was just there
- assuming that how we see is well understood
- assuming that seeing is all accounted for by the physics
- conflating rays (the theoretical construct) with light beams (the physical)

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
