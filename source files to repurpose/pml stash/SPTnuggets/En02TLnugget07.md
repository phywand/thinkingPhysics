StepHeader{Describing an elastic band}

It may seem a bit of a mouthful in class to talk about:

TeacherSpeak{The elastic store of energy associated with the rubber band.}

However, it would be perfectly acceptable to refer to:

TeacherSpeak{The elastic store of the rubber band.}

&hellip; or to hold up the rubber band and say:

TeacherSpeak{Here we have a rubber band, an elastic store.}
