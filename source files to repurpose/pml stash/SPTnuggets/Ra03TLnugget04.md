From a teaching and learning point of view it is well worth the time and effort to introduce new terms carefully.

When two sets of waves interact and combine, the phenomenon is termed QuoteThis{superposition} and the waves are said to QuoteThis{interfere}.

If the two sets of waves are directly in phase (or in step) at a certain point, the wave amplitudes add together and full QuoteThis{constructive interference} occurs.

If the two sets of waves are directly out of phase (or out of step) at a certain point, the wave amplitudes cancel each other out and full QuoteThis{destructive interference} occurs.

TeacherTip{If two contributions superpose then there is interference.}

TeacherTip{Contributions in step are in phase: <br> <br> Superposition SymbolArrowright constructive interference.}
