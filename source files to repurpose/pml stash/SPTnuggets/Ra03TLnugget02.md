This episode starts by thinking about what happens when two trains of waves meet one another.

The waves in question might be water waves in the ocean, or sound waves at a music concert or light waves from the Sun.

The same underlying principles apply to all such examples when considering how the trains add together.

Later there are not such obvious trains, but the same patterns of reasoning turn out to be reliable in predicting what happens.
