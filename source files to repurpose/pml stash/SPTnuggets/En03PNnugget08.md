Energy resources are depleted, and are not conserved. Some resources are reckoned as renewable: this depends on the timescale over which the stores is refilled.

Power stations deplete resources at rates depending on their design, and so switch power to the national grid. Energy is shifting from stores at the designed rate, and power in the electrical pathway is switched again by the final 'consumer' to perform some useful task. The national grid is a power distribution system.
