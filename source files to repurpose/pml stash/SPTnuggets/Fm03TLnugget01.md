ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- re-activate children's ideas about forces and energy
- connect to the measures of motion to everyday concerns
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- use diagrams, words and actions that separate force, momentum and energy
- keep scalars and vectors separate
- exploit common patterns
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
