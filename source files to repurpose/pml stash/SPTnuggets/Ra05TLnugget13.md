WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- dealing with the properties of ionising radiations before dealing with the sources
- building up a simplified model of the atom, as needed
- introducing a wide variety of sources, not only nuclear
- building and discussing models of exponential decay
- relating emissions to transmutations
- exploiting a good model of energy, discussing changes in the nuclear store
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- not drawing attention to the vastly different energies of photons with nuclear and atomic origins
- not emphasising the nuclear origins of the ionising emissions
- using the term QuoteThis{atomic power}
- keeping the different representations of exponential decay separate, rather than relating them
- avoiding QuoteThis{negative energy}, when accounting for nuclear transformations

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
