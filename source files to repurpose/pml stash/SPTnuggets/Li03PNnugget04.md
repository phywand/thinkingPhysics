StepHeader{Reflection from any surface}

The law of reflection is usually illustrated in science textbooks with flat or plane mirrors. You should be aware, however, that it applies to the reflection of light at any surface, not just the QuoteThis{shiny} ones that you might usually associate with reflection.

For example, each point on a stone wall reflects light such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Here you need to picture a tiny piece of the wall's surface, which acts as a plane reflector. Having to hand a piece of rock containing mica flakes, which are shiny, might help to make the link to the reflection of light from a duller rock.

Once again, you can see why the angles of incidence and reflection are measured in relation to the normal line. In this case of reflection from an uneven stone wall, the reflecting surface does not provide a straight line to measure angles against. Reflection from such a rough surface is sometimes referred to as diffuse reflection.
