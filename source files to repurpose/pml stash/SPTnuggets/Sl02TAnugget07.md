StepHeader{Purpose}

This activity reinforces the need to set an object vibrating to make a sound, and explored the varying ways in which it can be set vibrating.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- pencil and paper
- perhaps display cards
- a small collection of objects (Perhaps a few rounded stones, a few short lengths of string, a rubber band, a piece of paper, a 15 cm ruler
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Set the children a class group or individual task of listing how many different ways they can find to make noise using the object, or the small set of objects.

Do spend some time to get the children thinking along the right lines by activating the previous work in this area. Similarly do conclude with a plenary discussion to highlight some key findings, amongst which might be:

ListInformation
- something must vibrate
- the vibrations can be big or small
- the vibrations can be rapid or slow
ListInformationEnd

To reflect on, analyse or record their findings the children can:

ListInformation
- present a report, either written or oral
- group the sounds they hear into categories using display cards by moving to stand by these cards
