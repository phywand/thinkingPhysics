RightLines{Reflection of light occurs at any surface, such that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and not just mirrors.}

StepHeader{Starting with mirrors}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Many children come to associate reflection and the law of reflection of light solely with the action of plane mirrors. They are often unaware that reflection (with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of reflection) occurs when light meets any surface.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Start your teaching with the reflection of light from plane mirrors to establish the law of reflection, then move on to diffuse reflection from irregular surfaces. The point to emphasise here is that the law of reflection of individual rays of light applies to both regular and diffuse reflection.
