WrongTrack{If a car headlamp bulb has a power rating of ValueUnit{24}{watt}, this means that it always gives out ValueUnit{24}{joule} of heat and light energy each second.}

RightLines{If a car headlamp bulb has a power rating of ValueUnit{24}{watt}, this means that it is designed to shift ValueUnit{24}{joule} of energy per second at its normal operating voltage of ValueUnit{12}{volt}. However, if the voltage is reduced (say to ValueUnit{6}{volt}) then the power output will fall below ValueUnit{24}{watt} and the bulb will be dimmer than normal.}

So an electrical device such as a light bulb can have a full range of power outputs depending on the operating conditions. If the supply voltage falls, then so too will the current and the power output of the bulb will be reduced.

Household light bulbs are rated and sold in terms of their power output, but you need to bear in mind that figures of ValueUnit{100}{watt} or ValueUnit{60}{watt} apply for the normal ValueUnit{240}{volt} supply.
