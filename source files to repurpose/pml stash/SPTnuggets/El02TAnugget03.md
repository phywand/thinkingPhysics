The questions might be used for homework or as the basis for discussion in class.

The question QuoteThis{Which way around?} targets the point that the direction that individual cells are connected in influences their effect on the circuit. Both cells need to be pointing in the same direction to provide a greater push on the charged particles, and to shift more energy to the charged particles as they pass through the battery.

ListInformation
- Circuit (b) is the brightest; the batteries are pointing in the same direction.
- Circuit (c) is the dimmest; the bulb will not light at all.
- Circuits (a) and (d) are of the same brightness; in circuit (d) two of the batteries are connected in the same direction, whilst the third is facing in the opposite direction.

The question QuoteThis{Remove battery} probes the way in which the current changes when the number of batteries in a circuit is reduced. When one of the batteries is removed, the current in the bulb gets less (but is not zero) because one battery exerts a smaller push on the charged particles.

The question QuoteThis{Add battery} probes the way in which the bulb brightness changes when the number of batteries in a circuit is increased. When an extra battery is added the bulb gets brighter because the extra battery pushes a bigger current around the circuit, and with the extra battery more energy is shifted by the charged particles.
