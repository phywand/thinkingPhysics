ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- idealise from everyday experiences the lived-in world to develop the idea of a natural motion
- distinguish between everyday motions of the lived-in world and the idealised world of Newtonian mechanics
- draw out children's ideas of force and motion
- reactivate, and then use children's prior learning
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- represent idealised motions as natural motions in a frictionless world
- deal with remote causesâ€”action at a distance forces
- introduce mass, and not conflated with quantity of matter
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
