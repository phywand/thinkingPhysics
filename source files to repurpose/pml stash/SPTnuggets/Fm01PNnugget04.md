StepHeader{Three kinds of forces: identifying forces to replace interactions}

As you isolate an object from its environment SymbolEndash in order to place the object in a completely natural environment SymbolEndash so you'll find the need to categorise the kinds of interactions with the environment, in order to identify the forces. These interactions can be of two kinds: interactions with the local environment and interactions with the non-local environment. In the object's new stripped-down environment, these are replaced by, respectively, contact and non-contact forces.

Forces (in the SPT: Forces topic) were first introduced as acting on objects to support those objects SymbolEndash so performing the same function as a human agent. This kind of agency on the part of the environment is as a result of interactions between the object and the environment that can be replaced by a force exerted by the environment. That force can support an object, and it's at right angles to the surface of the object SymbolEndash a normal force. These normal forces can also accelerate or retard objects, so perhaps, now that you know a little more about normals (perhaps from the SPT: Light topic), we can comfortably call this set QuoteThis{normal forces}.

The contact forces are of two further kinds: those that are normal to the surface of the object in contact with the environment and those that retard. In the SPT: Forces topic these were called forces that can support and frictional forces. Now we'd suggest using somewhat more apposite and precise collective terms: QuoteThis{normal forces} and QuoteThis{retarding forces} (these forces always act so as to reduce motion).

Then there are the three forces that act without contact: gravity, electrical and magnetic.

So there are three by three SymbolEndash that is, nine different kinds of forces that might appear. Here is a table of the forces and the interactions.

And here are the nine forces, in their three groups:

As you move from from the messy complex world to the simple natural world for un-skinned objects, focus on particular facets of the environment to check if these are such that the interactions require a force arrow to be added in the new world in order to reproduce the effect of the interaction.

In moving from the lived-in world to the object's natural environment, you really are re-imagining the world SymbolEndash you're creating a parallel universe where the rules are different.
