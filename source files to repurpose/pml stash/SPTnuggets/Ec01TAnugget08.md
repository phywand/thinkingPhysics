StepHeader{On-Off Switches}

StepHeader{Purpose}

Simple make or break switches complete or  break single loops.  Here  children investigate the simple on-off switches, devising a number of different ways of making and breaking loops.

ListEquipment
- a large complete electrical loop
- a collection of pieces of conductor to make switches
- batteries, bulbs, wires

StepHeader{Happens}

Show a large complete loop,  containing a battery and a bulb,  and then ask how to turn the bulb on and off. Extend the question to include turning the bulb on or off from a large number of different locations around the loop. Here you can emphasise the loop as a complete system, because what happens at one point affects the entire loop.

The children should have a go at devising their own switches, aiming both for elegant solutions and for intriguing solutions,  as well as simple reliable switches.  Having to hand a few large switches (ensure that these are on-off switches) of a variety of designs will encourage the children to adopt different approaches.
