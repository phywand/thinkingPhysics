StepHeader{Purpose}

The Earth&apos;s magnetism has a significant effect on what&apos;s possible for life on the planet. This interesting starting point can form the basis of a number of research activities.

The Earth behaves as if it has a giant bar magnet inside.

You might launch the research by showing a floating needle being aligned by the Earth&apos;s magnetism. Here&apos;s how to set that up:

ListInformation
- magnetise the needle by rubbing the a pole of a bar magnet along it several times from the eye to the point
- use tape to stick the needle to the top of the cork
- fill a bowl with water
- float the needle on the cork in the water
ListInformationEnd

The magnetised needle spins until it is aligned with the Earth&apos;s magnetism. You could emphasise that this is a magnetic effect by bringing a bar magnet alongside the bowl, and noticing the needle re-align.

The Earth&apos;s magnetism plays a really crucial role in protecting the Earth and is used in navigation.  Pupils could research some interesting , for example: the Northern Lights; magnetic navigation in birds; early use of lodestone as a compass on land and at sea.

TeacherTip{Scientists have been studying the Earth&apos;s magnetism for years and yet there is still no consensus on how it works. So don&apos;t be drawn into trying to explain it.}
