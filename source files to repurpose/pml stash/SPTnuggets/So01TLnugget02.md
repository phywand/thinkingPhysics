StepHeader{Pupils' views on how we hear}

Our experience tells us that there is not a big variation in the views that children of this age bring to their science lessons. Nevertheless, it is a good idea to probe the understanding of your pupils at the start of any lesson sequence or module.

Here is a sheet that might be used to probe pupils' thinking on sound, allowing them to show what they understand. Included are the responses of six pupils to the sheet.
