ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- draw on what pupils have learned about drawing arrows to represent forces
- reactivate their knowledge about resultant forces and natural motions
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- separate arrows representing force from arrows representing movement
- develop a good exposition of terminal speed
- describe situations where the resultant force is equal to 0
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
