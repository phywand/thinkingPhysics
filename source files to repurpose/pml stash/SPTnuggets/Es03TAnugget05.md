This activity is designed to further pupils' understanding of the size of the universe. The written and picture cards cover the biggest and smallest objects imaginable. The idea is to use the cards according to the level and need of your class. Pupils can match and/or sequence all or some of the cards as you see fit.

Start with the whole class and discuss things which are bigger and smaller than them. Most suggestions offered by the class are likely to be of an observable size (e.g. a house, a mouse). Encourage pupils to think wider and to increase the range.

Note these suggestions on large post-it notes to allow pupils to sequence them on the board.

Next, ask the class to offer estimates of sizes for the examples that they have given. There is likely to be some confusion and discussion as to exact figures. Allow this to take place, do not shut down the discussion.

This whole class debating should be no more than 10 to 15 minutes.

Now divide the pupils into groups of 3 or 4. Each group should be given a pack of cards to sort. As mentioned above there is a variety of levels of cards to best meet the needs of each group of pupils. You may decide there are too many, if so just leave some out. You also need to know about the maths level of the pupils before deciding whether to include the assigning of powers of ten.

Your time frame will depend on what you decided to include, but no more than 20 minutes should be spent on this part of the activity.

Finally draw the class back together and agree a correct sequence. You may wish them to record some key sizes.
