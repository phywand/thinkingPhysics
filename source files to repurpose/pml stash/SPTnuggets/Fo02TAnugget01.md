StepHeader{Happens}

You might use a vertically hanging slinky as a teaser or starter:

TeacherSpeak{Why are the coils of my hanging slinky farther apart than those at the bottom?&hellip;  No, don't answer straight off. We're going to have a look at a question together that'll help us to construct a good explanation.}

Use the question to set up a discussion, using groups of 3 or 4.

The question can lead naturally into discussions about the tension in a rope, whether hanging or horizontal. Some useful ideas can be explored, for more confident pupils, by discussing the tension in the rope during a tug of war.
