WebTitle{Adding beams of light(Activity)}

StepHeader{Combining colours of light}

StepHeader{Purpose}

Here you can arrange three overlapping coloured beams of light to fall onto a screen, showing the colours that arise from adding the beams together.

StepHeader{Prepare} 

ListEquipment
- a three beam projector (typically this will have three filters (red, blue and green), perhaps with mirrors to generate three separate beams from one lamp)
- a white screen
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Show the three beams initially overlapped, thereby producing white light. Then split them into the three primary beams, finally combining them in pairs to produce the secondary colours.
