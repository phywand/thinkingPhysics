ListInformation
- Most moving objects are acted upon by a QuoteThis{driving} force and retarding (often frictional) forces acting in the opposite direction to the motion.
- When these forces add to zero (the resultant force is zero), the object maintains a constant speed.
- When the forces do not add to zero (there is a non-zero resultant force), the object will either speed up, slow down or change direction.
