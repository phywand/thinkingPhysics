WrongTrack{The changing potential difference across the primary coil is ValueUnit{12}{volt} and this gives ValueUnit{120}{volt} across the secondary coil. So, since volts tell us the number of JustUnit{joule / coulomb}, there must be a 10 times gain in energy from the transformer!}

RightLines{The point to remember is that, if the potential difference across the secondary coil goes up by 10 times, the current through the secondary coil goes down by 10 times.}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

The basic assumption in thinking about the working of a transformer is that there must be a power balance across it. The input power and output power must be equal. In other words, it is impossible to get more energy out than is put in. With this in mind, let's consider the following transformer set up: FractionAdBeqCdD{input turns}{output turns}{1}{10}

The potential difference across the primary coil is ValueUnit{12}{volt}.

The current in the primary coil is ValueUnit{2}{ampere}.

TeacherSpeak{OK! So what's the power input to the input coil of the transformer?}

PupilSpeak{Al}{Is it 12 times 2, that's ValueUnit{24}{watt}?}

TeacherSpeak{Exactly: ValueUnit{12}{volt}   SymbolMultipliedby  ValueUnit{2}{ampere}! Well done! And what does ValueUnit{24}{watt} tell us?}

PupilSpeak{Susan}{ValueUnit{24}{joule inverse second} is delivered to the input side of the transformer.}

TeacherSpeak{Excellent! Now, there are 10 times the number of coils on the output coil as compared to the input coil, so what must be the potential difference across the output?}

PupilSpeak{Greg}{ValueUnit{120}{volt}.}

TeacherSpeak{Good! Now, if we assume that the transformer is ValueUnit{100}{&percnt;} efficient, what does that mean?}

PupilSpeak{Shapi}{That the power out is the same as the power in.}

TeacherSpeak{OK. If we assume that there is ValueUnit{100}{&percnt;} efficiency, who can tell me what the current in the output coil must be? The power output must be ValueUnit{24}{joule inverse second}, the potential difference is ValueUnit{120}{V}, so what's the current?}

PupilSpeak{Gail}{ValueUnit{0.2}{ampere}?}

TeacherSpeak{Yes, exactly right! ValueUnit{0.2}{ampere}. The potential difference goes up by 10 times and the current goes down by ten times to keep the balance of power across the transformer. The same number of JustUnit{joule second -1} come out as go in.}
