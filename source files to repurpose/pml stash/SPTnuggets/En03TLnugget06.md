ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Sometimes the conservation of energy conflicts with our intuition that things get used up and lost to further use. This is understandable in the case of burning something like methylated spirits in air to warm up some water. After the process, the meths has obviously gone. We cannot use it again. So just how does conservation apply here?

Perhaps the best approach in such cases is to emphasise, time and again, the spreading out of the energy amongst many small stores. In the case of the meths, the water is warmed, but so is the air, the container for the water and the burner. In addition, some radiation is emitted, which could end up warming something far away. Of course the collective name for all of these actions is dissipation. Rather than just providing this label, it may be more convincing for children to explicitly search out all of the stores that are filled (some only a small amount) as they track the energy leaving the original chemical store.
