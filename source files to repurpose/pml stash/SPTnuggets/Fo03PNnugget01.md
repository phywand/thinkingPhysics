In this episode we look at a group of forces SymbolEndash magnetic, electric and gravitational SymbolEndash which are different in kind from the pushes and pulls of episode 02. So, in what way are they different? The key point is that these three forces allow remote parts of the environment to exert a force on an object without being in contact with it. Thus, a magnet attracts or repels another magnet; a rubbed (or electrically charged) rubber balloon attracts other things that are charged; the Earth attracts anything with mass. Each of these is an QuoteThis{action-at-a-distance} or QuoteThis{non-contact} force.

These days the concept of QuoteThis{gravity} is relatively common-place. If you ask people why things fall, more often than not they will tell you that it is because of the pull of gravity. Despite this familiarity, we should not lose sight of the fact that this is a very strange idea indeed and has been the subject of puzzlement throughout the history of science.

For example, if you drop a melon from the top of a building, how can the Earth (whose surface is some ValueUnit{10}{metre} away) exert a force on that melon?

What we do know is that such action-at-a-distance forces are very real and we experience them every day. All three non-contact forces decrease in strength as separation between objects increases. Each force is given a brief introduction in this narrative. This is extended in the expansion sections.
