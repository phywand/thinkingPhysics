StepHeader{Champion of constant speeds}

A science teacher colleague, when talking about forces that add to zero and constant speed, always boasts to his class that he is a QuoteThis{world champion} in achieving constant speeds. The build-up to his claims of QuoteThis{special expertise} is so great that the pupils are soon clamouring to find out what he does to achieve these constant speeds, QuoteThis{neither speeding up&hellip;  nor slowing down}.

And so the story goes: 

TeacherSpeak{Well first of all I jump into my car and drive up onto the M62 motorway. Then I get into the outside lane and accelerate up to 70 miles per hour. Once at 70 mph, if the air resistance increases, and I start slowing, I gently press my foot down on the accelerator to increase the driving force. If I start speeding up, I think QuoteThis{driving force greater than air resistance} and I take my foot off the accelerator slightly to bring the forces back in line. It's such fun driving the car and keeping those forces in balance!}

If my colleague is having a really good day, he goes further by claiming that he can also achieve constant speeds with pencil cases. With further great build-up he gets the class around a bench, borrows a pencil case and pushes the case at a constant speed across the surface.

TeacherSpeak{Ooops, just a little too much on the pushing side there, keep the push equal to the friction. Just look at that! Steady speed with no resultant force!}

Amazingly his classes seem to enjoy these antics.
