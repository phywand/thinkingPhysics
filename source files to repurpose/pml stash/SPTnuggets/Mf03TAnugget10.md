StepHeader{Purpose}

To help children describe the world by acquiring a feeling for what a one newton slip force feels like.

ListEquipment
- one newton force apparatus ( a 100 g apple, hidden in a box, that can be raised or lowered by string running over a pulley)
- A cardboard force arrow, labelled QuoteThis{1 newton}, attached ot the end of the string

StepHeader{Happens}

You might rather lightly introduce the idea that the length of the force arrows is measured in newtons (depending on whether you&apos;ve used this measure before), and use an everyday example so that children get a feel for the size of a one newton slip force. It happens that about half a cup full of tea, pushed across a desk, results in a slip force of about one newton. You might also have something suitably heavy in the classroom that pulling it across the floor results in a slip force of ValueUnit{10}{newton} SymbolEndash you&apos;ll need to try this out to find something.
