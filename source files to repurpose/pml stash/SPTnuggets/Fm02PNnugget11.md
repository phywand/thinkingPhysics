In this episode you've concentrated on the relationships between the measures of motion, exploring the connections between acceleration, velocity and displacement.

ListInformation
- Acceleration accumulates velocity.
- Velocity accumulates displacement.

In the first episode you concentrated on the causes of motion SymbolEndash that is, what got things going and otherwise changed their motion: QuoteThis{A resultant force causes a change in motion.} These eight words imply a lot of understanding: the whole of the SPT: Forces topic and the whole of the SPT: Motion topic are needed to really understand the phrase. Physics may be simple but it is quite subtle.

ListInformation
- Force causes acceleration.
- Mass impedes acceleration.

Now we simply put the three together to get a very powerful synthesis: a way of building predictive models of the world that are very reliable guides to action.

ListInformation
- FractionBlock{force}{mass} sets acceleration
- Acceleration accumulates velocity.
