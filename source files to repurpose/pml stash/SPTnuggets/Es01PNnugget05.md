Suppose you want to calculate the size of the gravitational force acting between you and your colleague as you approach each other (one metre apart) in the corridor. We can do this quite simply by using Newton's equation: EqualityAssertion{WordSub{force}{gravity}}{FractionBlock{QuantitySymbol{G} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{M} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{m}}{WordSuper{separation}{2}}} .

Suppose: your mass, QuantitySymbol{m}, is ValueUnit{60}{kilogram}; the mass of your colleague, QuantitySymbol{M}, is ValueUnit{70}{kg}; your centre-to-centre separation, QuantitySymbol{r}, is ValueUnit{1}{m}; and  QuantitySymbol{G} is ValueExponent{6.67}{-11}{newton square metre kilogram -2}.

Inserting these values into the equation to get ValueExponent{6.67}{-11}{newton square metre kilogram -2} SymbolMultipliedby FractionBlock{ValueUnit{60}{kilogram}  SymbolMultipliedby ValueUnit{70}{ kilogram}}{WordSuper{ValueUnit{1}{metre}}{2}}. You can work out this force and you'll get ValueExponent{2.8}{-7}{newton}.

In other words you exert a gravitational pulling force of GroupBlock{0.28 millionths of a newton} on your colleague! The force exists but it is too small to notice in practice.

From the numbers it is clear that because the value of G is so small, the magnitude of the gravitational force will be very small, unless one or other of the objects has a very large mass.

You can use Newton's equation to check out the empirical observation that a ValueUnit{1}{kilogram} mass experiences a gravitational pull of about ValueUnit{10}{N} at the surface of the Earth. This is calculating the gravitational pull at the Earth's surface

EqualityAssertion{WordSub{force}{gravity}}{FractionBlock{QuantitySymbol{G} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{M} SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{m}}{WordSuper{separation}{2}}}

Where: mass, QuantitySymbol{m}, is ValueUnit{1}{kilogram}; mass of the Earth, QuantitySymbol{M}, is ValueExponent{6.0}{24}{kilogram}; the radius of the Earth (separation of masses), QuantitySymbol{r}, is ValueExponent{6.4}{6}{m}; and QuantitySymbol{G} is ValueExponent{6.67}{-11}{newton square metre kilogram-2}}.

Inserting these values into the equation,  and work this out to get a force of ValueUnit{9.8}{newton} .

As expected, the pull of the Earth on a ValueUnit{1}{kilogram} mass at its surface is about ValueUnit{10}{N} .
