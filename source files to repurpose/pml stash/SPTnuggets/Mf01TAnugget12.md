StepHeader{Adding those arrows}

This a part of a suggested sequence:

InsertLinkTA{A repertoire to develop the idea of falling}{MF02TA.html#01}

StepHeader{Purpose}

There you can see the universality of gravity: there will be force arrows on all falling objects.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a wide variety of objects to drop (avoid anything fragile)
- a set of cardboard gravity arrows
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Drop the objects one at the time, and QuoteThis{walk through} their falling journey. Choose any point on this walk-through other than the beginning or the end of the journey.

For each of the objects in turn, run a discussion such that the endpoint is adding a gravity force arrow to the object. Ensure that you have plenty of gravity force arrows so that at the end of the activity you can have an array of objects, displayed to show the gravity arrows on the objects at some stage during a fall (perhaps deliberately at various stages of the fall).
