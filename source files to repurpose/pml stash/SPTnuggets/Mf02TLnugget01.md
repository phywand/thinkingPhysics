The classification of materials into electrical conductors and insulators in primary school suggests to children that metals are special when it comes to electricity. It is not therefore surprising that the same classification is transferred in children&apos;s thinking to the topic of magnetism. Metals are expected to be magnetic and non-metals are expected to be non-magnetic.
