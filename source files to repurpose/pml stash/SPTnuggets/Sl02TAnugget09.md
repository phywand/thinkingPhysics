This a part of a suggested sequence:

InsertLinkTA{A repertoire to develop the idea of hearing}{Sl02TA.html#01}

StepHeader{Purpose}

This activity focuses on the idea that anything producing a sound must be vibrating. We think it best to start off with sources that involve obvious vibrations and then look at more subtle movements later.

StepHeader{Prepare}

You will need a collection of things that vibrate along with the means of showing that they do vibrate. We suggest:

ListEquipment
- a large panel of hardboard (approx: ValueUnit{1}{metre} by ValueUnit{1}{metre}) popularised as the QuoteThis{wobble board}
- a tuning fork and a bowl of water, together with a table tennis ball suspended on a long piece of fishing line
- a large open loudspeaker, a means of playing music and some dried peas
ListEquipmentEnd

To take it further:

ListEquipment
- a small wind-up music box and access to a table to use as a sounding board
- a small loudspeaker (ValueUnit{50}{millimetre} diameter) and access to a pane of glass
ListEquipmentEnd

SafetyTip{Signal generators driving loudspeakers have been known to produce unpleasant feelings, even nausea, in susceptible individuals at a variety of frequencies from as low as ValueRange{4}{15}{hertz}to above ValueUnit{20}{kilohertz}.}


StepHeader{Making sources}

StepHeader{Happens}

Start with the wobble board SymbolEndash just wobble it to and fro slowly in an exaggerated action. As you increase the rate of wobbling, start to talk about the vibrations of the board, connecting this use of QuoteThis{vibration} with the to and fro action. Ask what the board is doing to the air next to it. Slow the action right down so you can emphasise the push  and pull on the air. Emphasise that the vibrating board sets air into a to and fro motion.

Introduce the tuning fork as something which makes a sound, but which we cannot see moving. (In fact our eyes cannot react fast enough to catch it moving, added to which it is not moving very far.) You can show that the prongs of the tuning fork are moving by dipping the end in a bowl of water. Try drawing the children in close as you demonstrate this on the pretext of trying to see the very small vibrations. The children will be wetted by the water particles as they are displaced by the to and fro action of the fork.

StepHeader{Extensions and discussion}

An alternative is to suspend a table tennis ball on a long piece of fishing line beside the vibrating fork, so that the fork collides with it at the extremity of its vibration.

A further way of QuoteThis{seeing} the vibrations is to polish up one end of the tuning fork (right at the end) and then bounce a light beam off the outside of the end at a glancing angle , so that the reflected spot ends up on the wall a long way off. This is tricky and time-consuming to set up.

To make lots of air vibrate (as you did with the wobble board), just place the stem of the tuning fork on a wooden table and listen out as the table is set vibrating. A nice alternative is to have a music box playing, first with it held in the air and then with it resting on the table.

A further activity at this stage involves setting up a circus of vibrating objects (including a range of musical instruments) and getting children to QuoteThis{spot the vibration} that is acting as the source of the sound.

To use the loudspeaker, place the loudspeaker so that it faces upwards and then put the dried peas on the surface. With the loudspeaker connected to the music system, the peas jump about as the speaker cone vibrates.

Two extensions to discuss:

ListInformation
- Rooms can be bugged by bouncing light beams from the windows (health and safety is not so much of a concern for spies, but we don&apos;t suggest you try this), detecting any to and fro motion of the window pane. What would create such a motion? This is the stuff of spy stories.
- Small loudspeakers are available that can be clamped to window panes. The loudspeaker sets the whole window pane vibrating to get lots of air moving. This produces a much louder sound.
