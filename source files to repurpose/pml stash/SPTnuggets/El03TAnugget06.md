WebTitle{Predicting and measuring voltages in a parallel circuit(Activity)}

StepHeader{Voltage in parallel circuits}

StepHeader{Purpose}

The approach taken is to encourage the pupils to make predictions of voltage values before they make each measurement.

StepHeader{Happens}

For this activity, the pupils should ideally work in pairs and each pair has one voltmeter that is placed in the different positions in the circuits as shown on the worksheet.

As the pairs of pupils complete their measurements, it is a good idea to collect the voltage values on the board or on a large sheet of poster paper, so that the pattern of findings becomes apparent to all.

Give the pupils a chance to talk through these new ideas, as they review the voltage values for the whole class.
