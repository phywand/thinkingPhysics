StepHeader{Drawing forces}

In drawing in the forces around a lever, encourage the pupils to think through a checklist (episode 01 of SPT: Forces topic) before placing each arrow:

TeacherSpeak{What provides the force?}
PupilSpeak{Lois}{My hand (the QuotationThis{effort}).}
TeacherSpeak{What is the force acting on?}
PupilSpeak{Sarah}{The lever.}
TeacherSpeak{Where does the force act?}
PupilSpeak{Eloise}{At one end of the lever.}
TeacherSpeak{What is the strength of the force?}
PupilSpeak{Zac}{XX newtons.}
TeacherSpeak{How long shall we make the arrow to represent this force?}
PupilSpeak{Ibrahim}{Shorter than the force on the load.}
TeacherSpeak{In which direction does the force act?}
PupilSpeak{Penel}{Downwards.}
