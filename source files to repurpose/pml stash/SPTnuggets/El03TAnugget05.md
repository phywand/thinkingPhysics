The questions might be used for homework or as the basis for discussion in class.

Resistors in series: designed to probe pupils' understanding of how voltage is shared between two identical resistors in series.

(a) QuantitySub{V}{1} reads ValueUnit{3}{volt}
(b) The battery voltage is shared, half across each resistor.

Different batteries: probes pupils' understanding of the relationship between the battery voltage and the total voltage across external resistors.
CharList
- QuantitySub{V}{1} is ValueUnit{6}{volt}; QuantitySub{V}{2} is ValueUnit{3}{volt}
EndList

Different resistors: probes pupils' understanding of how voltage is shared between unequal resistors.

CharList
- QuantitySub{V}{1} is ValueUnit{4}{volt}; QuantitySub{V}{2} is ValueUnit{5}{volt}; QuantitySub{V}{3} is ValueUnit{4}{volt}
EndList

Bigger resistance: probes pupils' understanding of how voltage is shared between unequal resistors.

CharList
- QuantitySub{V}{1} reads between ValueUnit{6}{volt} and ValueUnit{3}{volt}
- The battery voltage is shared, with the larger share across the larger resistor.
EndList
