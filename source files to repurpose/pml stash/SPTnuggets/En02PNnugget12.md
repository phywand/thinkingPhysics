WebTitle{Shifting or transferring?(Expansion &ndash; tell me more)}

StepHeader{Choosing terminology}

We have chosen to use the word QuoteThis{shifting} to describe what happens when one energy store empties and another fills. We think that the idea of shifting helpfully supports the underlying understanding of energy leaving one store and turning up in another.

Of course, in many school physics books, the term QuoteThis{transfer} is used. If you are not happy with QuoteThis{shift}, then no inaccuracies ensue from replacing it with QuoteThis{transfer}. However, we thing it worth trying out the shifting approach. QuoteThis{Shift} is a simple and evocative word.
