WrongTrack{This is a ValueUnit{2}{ampere} bulb: it says so on the box. So if it is used in a circuit there must be a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere} flowing around the circuit and through the bulb.}

RightLines{The ValueUnit{2}{ampere} on the box refers to the current in the bulb when it is being used at its normal operating potential difference. A ValueUnit{12}{volt} and ValueUnit{2}{ampere} filament bulb has a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere} in the filament when used with a ValueUnit{12}{volt} supply so that there is a ValueUnit{12}{volt} drop across the bulb (wire the bulb directly across the supply).}

The key point for the student to get hold of here is that, so long as the current is not large enough to make the bulb fail, the bulb will allow any current to pass: the size of the current depends on the cell voltage. For example, if a ValueUnit{6}{volt} supply is used, the current through the bulb will be rather less than the ValueUnit{2}{ampere} expected for a ValueUnit{12}{volt} supply.

As students first start to make sense of electric circuits, their understanding might be QuoteThis{thrown} by the teacher referring to a QuoteThis{2 ampere bulb}, which seems to contradict the message that the electric current is a dependent variable (it depends on the cell potential difference and component resistance). Careless talk can therefore be confusing. We would suggest addressing the matter head-on and having the conversation with your students, following the leading question:
