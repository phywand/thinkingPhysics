Remember that, in getting parts of your body moving, it's not only the mass SymbolEndash there's bound to be something about levers in there somewhere as well. The complexity of the situation suggests that using body parts may not be a good idea when introducing inertial effects.

TeacherTip{Don't use parts of the body, or really anything that doesn't act as a point mass (so where you need to think about the internal structure), to introduce inertial mass and its effects. Concentrate on simple objects.}
