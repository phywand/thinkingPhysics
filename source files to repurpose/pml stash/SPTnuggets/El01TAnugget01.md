StepHeader{Happens}

Pupils work individually or in pairs on the questions and are encouraged to think and to write down their answers with as much detail as possible. The questions might be set for homework prior to the first lesson so that you have time to read through the responses. Alternatively, they might be used at the start of the first lesson while you move around looking at what the pupils are writing.
