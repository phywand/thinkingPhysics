WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- integrating your current model of energy
- introducing a range of frequency dependent phenomena
- developing and exploiting a photon model of radiating
- linking radiating to the other three pathways (electrical, mechanical, heating by particles)
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- rehearsing the QuoteThis{wave&ndash;particle duality arguments of early last century}
- making quantum physics too mystical
- using the photo-electric effect as the central phenomena in introducing photons
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
