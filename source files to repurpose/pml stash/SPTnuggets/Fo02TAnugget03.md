StepHeader{Happens}

Invite pupils to float the inflated balloon on the water, then to gently push the balloon into the water. The volume of the balloon is such that a considerable force upwards will be experienced by the pupils. This is such a simple exploration, yet one that few pupils will have experienced first hand.
