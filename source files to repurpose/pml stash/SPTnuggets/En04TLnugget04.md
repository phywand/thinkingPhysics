StepHeader{Energy stores as rubber bands}

Any energy store must be in some way like a stretched rubber band, since the band itself is a store. Filling energy stores is just like stretching rubber bands: emptying them is just like allowing rubber bands to relax again. Relaxing the rubber band allows some other job to be done SymbolEndash perhaps something gets lifted, or the band itself gets warmed.

TeacherSpeak{See how the stores that we have already introduced are like the rubber band.}

TeacherTip{When teaching about energy it is always helpful to have a few rubber bands to hand to make connections with different kinds of energy stores. For example, lifting a book up and increasing the amount of energy in its gravitational store can be likened to stretching the rubber band. Just as the stretched rubber band has a store of energy, so does the book in its elevated position in the Earth's gravitational field.}
