StepHeader{A selection of questions to explore understanding}

StepHeader{Purpose}

Select some questions that can be used to explore students' understandings of these rather difficult ideas. Because the shift from the idea that QuoteThis{force causes motion} to QuoteThis{force causes a change in motion} is hard, it's worth selecting questions that promote discussion of this very particular point.

There are many questions available on this topic, and in a variety of formats, from QuoteThis{discussion about instances}, through QuoteThis{predict, observe, explain}, to multiple choice in two and three step formats (first step SymbolEndash answer; second step SymbolEndash reason; third step SymbolEndash confidence). Many have been developed from research projects, and extensively trialled.

The questions should be selected to help learning, so for their formative value, rather than to make summative judgements.

StepHeader{Happens}

Students might be set some preparatory work, but the essence is to get a discussion going, and so allow space to fully explore the ideas. You'll need to create an environment where it's acceptable to make mistakes and engage in exploratory talk in order to ensure that they have got a grip on the ideas, and that you have the chance to find out where they are still uncertain.
