To make things memorable and to emphasise the physics, just follow what you do.

Talk through your action in building a circuit. The relationship between potential difference, resistance and current for the circuit may then make more sense.

Choose a cell, then choose a lamp. Build them into a loop circuit and find that the current in the lamp, and in the wires, and in the cell, is set by these choices.

So FractionBlock{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}} tells QuantitySymbol{I} what to be.

Written more conventionally:

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}

Now perform two quick checks:

As QuantitySymbol{V} gets closer to zero, so QuantitySymbol{I} gets closer to zero.

As QuantitySymbol{R} gets closer to zero, so QuantitySymbol{I} becomes very large.

These simple checks show that the relationship correctly represents what you observe in the circuits.

What you can choose:

- A potential difference: select the cell.
- A resistance: choose a resistor or lamp.

What you cannot choose:

ListInformation
- A current SymbolEndash that is the result of your first two choices.
