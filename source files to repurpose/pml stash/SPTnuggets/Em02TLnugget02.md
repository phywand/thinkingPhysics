ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

An electromagnet certainly looks quite different to a permanent bar magnet. It is therefore understandable that learners might believe that the two sources produce quite different kinds of magnetism.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

When moving on from permanent magnets to electromagnets it is worth emphasising the point that you are exploring a new way of producing the same kind of magnetic effect. Avoid giving the impression that you are starting a brand new topic.
