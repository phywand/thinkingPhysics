ThinkHeader{Learners: Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting}

How to:

ListInformation
- separate reflection and refraction
- avoid restricting the idea of reflection to shiny surfaces
- not conflate beams with rays
- reinforce the role of reflection in seeing
- connect seeing to both specular and diffuse reflections
- show where reflection and refraction occur outside the school laboratory

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- use ray diagrams to account for reflections
- use ray diagrams to account for refraction
- distinguish between shadows and rays
- show clear examples of the phenomena
- introduce a wide range of surfaces from which reflection happens
- introduce a wide range of changes of medium at which refraction happens

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
