It is quite common for teachers and students to talk about alpha, beta and gamma radiation. In fact, on first discovery (around 1900), all three were referred to as QuoteThis{rays} before their actual identity was established. Now we know that only gamma is a form of electromagnetic radiation, while alpha and beta QuoteThis{radiation} consist of streams of fast-moving particles.

The collective term QuoteThis{radiation} conceals the differing nature of the QuoteThis{radiations}. But as they all have the same effects, that's perhaps not a bad thing at this stage. Later on, in post-16 studies, it might be more appropriate to focus on the differences, when you can explain these more explicitly.
