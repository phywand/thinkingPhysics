The interactions of magnets serve as a template for the interactions of electromagnets. The similarity of the field around a bar magnet to the field around a coil of wire in which there is an electric current is one building block. The details of the interactions of fields are dealt with in the SPT: Electricity and energy topic, so a rather functional approach to the electromagnetic devices is probably sufficient here.
