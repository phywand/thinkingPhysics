Drawing on the previous sections, we have seen that it's possible to develop an QuoteThis{energy description} of electric circuits at a number of different QuoteThis{levels}. For example, suppose we have a simple circuit loop consisting of a ValueUnit{12}{volt} supply and a bulb in which there is a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere} (maybe a car headlamp bulb). It's possible to describe the loop in a number of different ways:

ListSequence
- Physical description: the bulb is connected to the supply cell and lights up.
- Shifting energy between stores: energy is shifted from the chemical store of the cell to the thermal store of the surroundings.
- Shifting energy along pathways: energy is shifted from the chemical store of the cell to the thermal store of the surroundings, first along an electrical working pathway, then along the QuoteThis{heating-by-particles} and QuoteThis{heating-by-radiation} pathways.
- Power and pathways: energy is shifted at the rate of ValueUnit{24}{joule inverse second}. There is a power of ValueUnit{24}{watt} in the electrical pathway and in the heating-by-particles and heating-by-radiation pathways.

A fundamental feature of any pathway is that it's possible to calculate the rate at which energy is shifted. This is the power in the pathway. In the case of the electrical pathway in this example, it's helpful for students to go back to first principles in thinking through the rate of shifting of energy along the pathway: this is the operating power of the pathway.

TeacherTip{So: with the ValueUnit{12}{volt} cell, the potential difference across the bulb is ValueUnit{12}{volt}. This means that ValueUnit{12}{joule} of energy is shifted for each coulomb of charge passing through the resistance of the bulb. With a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere}, ValueUnit{2}{coulomb} pass through the bulb each second.}

TeacherTip{So ValueUnit{24}{joule} of energy must be shifted each second by the bulb. ValueUnit{24}{joule} of energy is shifted each second, from cell to bulb, along the electrical working pathway, and ValueUnit{24}{joule} of energy is shifted each second from bulb to surroundings, along the heating pathways.}
