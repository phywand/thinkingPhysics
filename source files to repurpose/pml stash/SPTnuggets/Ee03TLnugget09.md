The explanation for the working of a transformer is a multiâ€“step QuoteThis{story} that most students will find pretty demanding.

What are the key steps in explaining how a simple transformer works? Let's think about a simple transformer set-up with input and output coils and a changing (alternating) potential difference across the primary.

ListSequence
- The changing potential difference drives a changing electric current round the primary.
- The changing electric current in the input produces a changing magnetic field: when the current is zero, the field is zero; when the current is at a maximum, the magnetic field is at maximum strength.
- The changing magnetic field is QuoteThis{carried} by the transformer core and linked to the output coil.
- The changing magnetic field linking the output induces a changing potential difference across the secondary coil.
- The changing potential difference across the secondary coil drives a changing current through that coil.

Two points to bear in mind with this explanation are:

ListInformation
- There is no electrical connection between input and output coils: the linkage is through the changing magnetic field.
- Even though the explanation involves going through a sequence of five steps, the steps occur simultaneously in real time.
