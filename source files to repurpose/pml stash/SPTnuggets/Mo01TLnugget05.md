Expressing a relationship in a form such as:

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{s}}{QuantitySymbol{d}}{QuantitySymbol{t}}

(where: QuantitySymbol{s} represents speed; QuantitySymbol{d} represents distance covered during trip; QuantitySymbol{t} represents trip time or duration of trip) is a familiar skill for those of us steeped in an education in science. However, for many learners such a formula is as remote as a piece of ancient Egyptian tomb writing. Using symbols rather than words presents a hurdle for many. This along with a lack of confidence in mathematical skills, which is evident in so many pupils, often results in an QuoteThis{I can't do this} cry of resignation.

The key approach here is to demystify the science by keeping the examples simple and by offering lots of positive encouragement through a celebration of success. It is a good idea to use words rather than symbols in the first instance. Give plenty of examples and keep the numbers simple. This will give learners a sense of achievement.

So, more like:

FractionABC{speed}{distance}{time}

Or, perhaps, more helpfully:

FractionABC{speed}{distance}{duration}
