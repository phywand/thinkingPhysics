The main teaching and learning challenges in this episode follow from:

ListInformation
- The use of familiar terms, such as QuoteThis{force}, in unfamiliar, specialist contexts
- The use of common sense ideas which may be incorrect from the scientific point of view
- The fact that you can't see forces SymbolEndash they require an abstract construction

The key is that we're after a simple, tractable description SymbolEndash a usable model. Make it simple enough and no simpler. The tendency to add not-needed, and often impairing complexity persists.

The model consists of one mass, and cunningly selected arrows, representing forces acting on that isolated mass.
