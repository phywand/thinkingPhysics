StepHeader{Purpose}

This is for a quick look only to show that it is possible to see magnetic fields in three dimensions, using iron filings. You may have a commercially available QuoteThis{3D field viewer}. In which case, this is less messy!

StepHeader{Prepare} 

ListEquipment
- chopped fine iron wool, placed in cooking oil, in a clear container.
- a strong magnet
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Bring the magnet in close enough and you will see the field in 3D. Do not try to record what you see. But do see how the two dimensional images that you draw are simple sections through the real pattern, which is three-dimensional.
