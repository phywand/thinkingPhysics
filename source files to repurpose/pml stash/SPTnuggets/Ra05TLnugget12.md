WebTitle{Does the mass halve in a half-life?(Challenge)}

StepHeader{What halves during a half life SymbolEndash tell me do, because I cannot see it?}

WrongTrack{If the half life of a radioactive source is 100 years, this means that half of the source will decay away in that time. If you have ValueUnit{10}{gram} of material at the start there will be ValueUnit{5}{gram} left after 100 years.}

RightLines{If the half-life of a radioactive source is 100 years, this means that half of the radioactive atoms will decay in that time but the source will undergo no significant change in mass.}

What halves during a time period of one half-life? This thinking that underpins this challenge relates closely to the challenge QuoteThis{Does a nucleus QuotationThis{disappear} when it decays?}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

It is worth addressing this issue directly:

TeacherSpeak{So if we start with ValueUnit{10}{g} of an alpha emitting radioactive source what will be its mass be after one half-life?}

PupilSpeak{Bill}{ValueUnit{5}{g}.}

TeacherSpeak{No, in fact that's not correct. There's virtually no change in mass of the source. Who can explain why? You need to think carefully about this.}

PupilSpeak{Simon}{You might think it's ValueUnit{5}{g} but it isn't because when the radioactive atoms decay they don't disappear, they just change into different atoms.}

TeacherSpeak{Great explanation! Out of interest how much mass will be lost from the source?}

PupilSpeak{Sarah}{The total mass carried away by the alpha particles. You lose two protons and two neutrons with each alpha particle.}

TeacherSpeak{That's pretty much all of it. In nuclear reactors you also lose a tiny fraction of the mass SymbolEndash in exchange for a lot of energy in a thermal store.}
