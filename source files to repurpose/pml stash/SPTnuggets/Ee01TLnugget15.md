The key insight here is that, when the second bulb is added in parallel to the existing loop, this second loop provides an additional pathway along which charge can be set in motion and the total current in the cell is doubled.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

We suggest two approaches: the rope loop; and illustrate with numbers.

Instead of one rope loop, we now have two, each containing a cell and a bulb.

With the same pull/push from the QuoteThis{cell} the two rope loops circulate at the same rate as each loop has the same resistance.

Each person gripping each rope loop feels the same heating effect (rope circulating at same rate, with same slip force applied).

This heating effect felt by each person is the same as when there was just one person gripping the rope.

Suppose that the cell drives a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere} in the original loop, containing a single bulb.

A second identical loop is added, again containing a single bulb.

The cell will drive a current of ValueUnit{2}{ampere} in this loop also.

The total current in the cell is now ValueUnit{4}{ampere}.
