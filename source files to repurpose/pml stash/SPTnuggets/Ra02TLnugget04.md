In introducing the idea that light shifts energy in discrete chunks, it is important to emphasise to students the key differences from a purely wave-based model:

In a wave model of light, energy is shifted in a continuous stream along the heating as radiation pathway. Imagine a continuous QuoteThis{flow} of the QuoteThis{orange energy liquid} introduced in the SPT: Energy topic, gradually filling up an energy store as it is absorbed. With the photon model, the image is one of a stream of QuoteThis{orange energy liquid} droplets filling an energy store chunk by chunk. Furthermore, different kinds of QuoteThis{light} (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) have energy chunks, or photons, of different value. For example, ultraviolet photons can be thought of as larger droplets than infrared photons. In other words, ultraviolet light shifts energy in bigger chunks.

The same droplet-like model applies to emptying stores SymbolEndash no longer a steady outward flow of liquid, but a drip-by-drip emptying.

TeacherTip{Now we're emptying and filling stores not by QuoteThis{pouring orange fluid} but QuoteThis{spoonful by spoonful}.}
