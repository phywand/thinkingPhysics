StepHeader{Happens}

The questions might be used for homework or as the basis for discussion in class.

The QuoteThis{Same circuit?} question is designed to probe pupils' ability to recognise equivalent ways of drawing a circuit with two parallel branches.

In fact, all of the circuit diagrams are correct representations.

The QuoteThis{Identical resistors} question probes understanding about the relative sizes of the electric current at different points in a parallel circuit.

CharList
- The current at c is the same size as the current at b.
- The current at d is the same size as the current at b.
- The current at a is bigger than the current at b.
- The current at e is the same size as the current at a.
EndList

The QuoteThis{Ammeter readings} question probes whether pupils can apply their understanding of electric current to a parallel circuit.

Circuit a: A1 is ValueUnit{0.3}{ampere}
Circuit b: A1 is ValueUnit{0.5}{ampere}; A3 is ValueUnit{0.3}{ampere}.
