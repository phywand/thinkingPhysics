It is very helpful to find out what your geography colleagues are teaching before starting the work on energy resources, as there is likely to be a fair overlap in the curriculum at this stage. Because of this we have concentrated on how the multiple energy resources that humans use are related to the scientific description in terms of energy stores and pathways. It would be helpful to come to an agreement with geography colleagues about how much they are going to cover in their treatment of alternatives in the energy economy.
