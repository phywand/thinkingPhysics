WebTitle{Building a model of the solar system with fruit(Activity)}

StepHeader{Using fruit to make a memorable model}

StepHeader{Purpose}

Here you construct a model of the solar system to show the relative size of the planets, the distance of each planet from the Sun and the spacing between the planets.

You can remind pupils that scientists frequently build models if the objects they are studying are either unimaginably large or too small to see.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- an out-of-doors space at least ValueUnit{11}{m} long
- a ValueUnit{15}{metre} tape measure 
ListEquipmentEnd

The following pieces of fruit:

ListEquipment
- 2 cherries or 2 small Brussels sprouts
- (1 slightly larger than the other SymbolEndash Mars is the larger one)
- 2 plums or 2 apricots
- 1 water melon or pumpkin
- 1 coconut or swede
- 1 apple
- 1 orange
- 1 pea
- A copy of the support sheet

StepHeader{Happens}

Nine pupils should make cards showing which planet they represent with lettering that will be visible from ValueUnit{10}{m} away when a photograph is taken.

Take the class outside.

Draw out a line and place the nine pupils to show where each planet is on the line. The pupils hold the fruit and the planet name so that everyone can see them.

TeacherTip{In these modelling activities it is important to be aware that the scale for the size of the planets is not the same scale as that used for the distance between them (although both the relative sizes and relative distances are to scale). If the scales were the same, the object representing Pluto would be about  ValueUnit{1.2}{kilometre} from the Sun.}
