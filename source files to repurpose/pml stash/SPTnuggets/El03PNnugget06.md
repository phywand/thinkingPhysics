This quantity, the amount of energy shifted by the bulb each second, is called the electrical power of the bulb.

The power of any device (whether electrical or mechanical) is defined as QuoteThis{EqualityAssertion{power}{energy transferred per second}}. You can write this as:

FractionABC{power}{energy}{duration}

In other words, a device has a high power output if it fills a selected store of energy very quickly. This idea can be applied to electrical devices, mechanical machines and even to people. For example, a trained athlete is able to ride a mountain bike up a steep slope quicker than a person of average fitness (so filling a gravitational store rapidly). The same amount of energy is needed for either person (provided they're about the same mass) to ride the bike up the hill. It's the athlete's ability to perform the task in a shorter period of time that shows that their power output is greater. We don't know, from these measurements, who has emptied their chemical store most rapidly. That would be a measure of the input power.

The standard unit of power is the watt, and the symbol used to represetn this is QuoteThis{W}.

FractionABC{power/watt}{energy/joule}{duration/second}

So: ValueUnit{1}{watt} is ValueUnit{1}{joule} of energy transferred per second and ValueUnit{100}{watt} is ValueUnit{100}{joule} of energy transferred per second.
