StepHeader{Is gamma more dangerous because it has greater penetrating power?}

WrongTrack{There are three types of radiation. Gamma is the most dangerous because it can even go through a sheet of lead. Alpha can be stopped by a sheet of paper so it is least dangerous.}

RightLines{The danger of a source to human tissue is not necessarily linked directly to its penetrating power.}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Students often assume that gamma radiation is more dangerous than alpha and beta because it has a greater penetrating power.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Students tend spontaneously to associate the greatest penetrating power with the greatest danger, but in fact alpha radiation, which has the smallest penetrating power, can in some cases be the most dangerous. For example, if the alpha-emitting radioactive material is taken into the body through the mouth or lungs, highly-ionising alpha radiation is emitted directly into human tissue with critical consequences.
