TeacherTip{Predicting the future, step by step, depends on knowing the values now and projecting forwards.}

Expressed as a relationship, you'd get: SumABC{WordSub{quantity}{new}}{WordSub{quantity}{old}}{change}

This business of change is so important that it's probably worth rearranging the relationship.

TeacherTip{Make a point of emphasising that DifferenceABC{change}{WordSub{quantity}{new}}{WordSub{quantity}{old}}.}

Knowing VectorSub{a}{instantaneous}  and VectorSub{v}{initial(1)} allows you to guess what the VectorSub{v}{later(1)} will be after a short interval (the longer the interval, the riskier the guess), SymbolDelta QuantitySub{t}{interval(initial(1)_final(1))}.

Knowing VectorSub{v}{instantaneous}  and VectorSub{d}{initial(2)} allows you to guess what the VectorSub{d}{later(2)} will be will be after a short interval (the longer the interval, the riskier the guess), SymbolDelta QuantitySub{t}{interval(initial(2)_final(2))}.

Using these instantaneous values to project forward in this way emphasises the fundamentals of kinematics, and uses the idea of accumulations.
