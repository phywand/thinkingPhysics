ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- distinguish between the physical descriptions of the lived-in world and the descriptions using the idea of energy
- avoid being drawn into conversations where energy is the QuoteThis{ultimate} cause
- build a semi-quantitative model of energy that pupils can reason with

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- represent conservation and dissipation
- use mechanisms to explain why things happen: energy calculations to explore what can happen
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
