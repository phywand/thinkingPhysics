WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- emphasising that there is movement as radiations travel from source to detector
- ensuring that radiating is presented as a unifying mechanism, across families of radiations
- using a simple, but evocative description of radiating, such as QuoteThis{do like me, but later}
- consistently characterising waves by their frequency and amplitude
- being consistent about the energy in stores and the power in pathways
- giving examples of the full range of media for each family of radiations
- explicitly modelling situations with ray diagrams

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- referring to QuoteThis{light energy}
- not implying that light simply QuoteThis{runs out}
- conflating rays with physical objects
- not making unifying connections between different phenomena

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
