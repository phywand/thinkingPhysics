A car speedometer reports the speed of the car at (near enough) a particular instant. Just look down and you know straight away how fast you are going. Such a speed is called an instantaneous speed. It is the speed at that particular instant. Speedometers rarely make an appearance in school science. For classroom experimenters, speed is a quantity which needs to be calculated using the relationship:

FractionABC{speed}{distance travelled}{time taken}

It is important to recognise that the calculated average QuoteThis{speed} does not represent the speed of a moving object at some particular instant.

Mary cycles to school. She travels ValueUnit{900}{metre} from her home to the school bike shed. She locks her bike and then walks the last ValueUnit{120}{metre} to the school building. The cycle ride takes two minutes and the walk takes one minute.

When cycling her (constant) speed was ValueUnit{7.5}{metre / second}. When walking her (constant) speed was ValueUnit{2}{metre / second}.

Let's calculate Mary's average speed.

FractionABC{average speed}{distance travelled}{time taken}

Which, in her case is FractionBlock{1020 metre}{180 second}, or FractionBlock{5.7 metre}{1 second}.

So Mary's average speed is ValueUnit{5.7}{metre / second}.
