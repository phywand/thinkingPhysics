StepHeader{Purpose}

This activity focuses on the design of devices to detect sounds. The structure of the ear is important here, but you will also want to be able to refer to microphones, as these transform the vibrations of the air into electrical vibrations.

- a model ear or a good clear diagram
- a microphone, linked a computer running sound-analysing software)
- a carefully chosen, large microphone opened up to show the parts

StepHeader{Happens}

Lead the class through a discussion whilst looking at the model ear, or at any sound sensing system, to draw out the way in which the to-and-fro motion of the medium is picked up by the detector. You should also point out that the brain works through processing electrical signals, and that&apos;s why ears have to perform this transforming action (from vibrations of the air to changing electrical signals in the brain). Microphones perform exactly the same transformation.

Connecting a microphone to a computer running suitable software can give a large-scale, clear representation of the vibration as a vertical trace on the screen. We strongly recommend that you do not produce a time trace, as explaining the resulting wave-like pattern is likely to lead children&apos;s thinking down the wrong tracks. It is better to keep things simple and to make the link: from the vibration of the sound to the vibration of the microphone diaphragm to the up and down vibration of the spot on the screen (producing the vertical line).
