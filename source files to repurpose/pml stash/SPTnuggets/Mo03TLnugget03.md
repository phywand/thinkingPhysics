WrongTrack{I hit the snooker ball with the cue and it speeds up right across the table.}

RightLines{The snooker ball speeds up from rest for as long as the cue is exerting a force on it. Once the ball loses contact with the cue it rolls across the table slowing down all the way (because of friction).}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

The key point to get over here is that the motion changes for just as long as a resultant force is acting. Very often objects gain their motion through a force acting over a short time (for example in kicking a ball; flicking a paper pellet; firing a catapult). In all such cases, it is worth spending some time in emphasising just when it is that the force is acting and the motion is changing.
