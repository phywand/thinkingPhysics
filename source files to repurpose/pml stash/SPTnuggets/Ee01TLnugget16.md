StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- Using and sharing an effective toolkit for thinking about circuits that allows you to make predictions
- Connecting thinking about your toolkit to choices made in assembling circuits on the benchtop
- interpreting equations as relationships between physical quantities
- giving a physical interpretation to equations
- using a range of representations to relate physical quantities (diagrams, words, mathematics, apparatus)

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- encouraging the QuoteThis{dash to the formula}
- using triangles to rearrange equations
- relying on rote substitutions into formulae
- using an incoherent set of ad-hoc rules and metaphors, each of restricted validity

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
