ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- draw on children's own experience of action at the distance, probably through experiences with magnets
- draw on children's experiences, some of which will be vicarious, to establish the reality of gravity in space
- explore something of the mystery of action at a distance
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- relate electric, magnetic and gravity forces, without conflating them
- separate the mass of an object from the force of gravity acting on an object, without being dogmatic
- treat freefall as a natural motion
ListInformationEnd
TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
