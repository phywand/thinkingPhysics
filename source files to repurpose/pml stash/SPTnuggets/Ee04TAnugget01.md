StepHeader{Purpose}

This demonstration allows you to calculate the energy shifted between kinetic and gravity stores. Several different starting points are easy to arrange, depending on whether the mass starts off up or down, and the trolley starts off moving or stationary. Adapt the possibilities to suit the class and the evolving discussion. You can and should calculate the efficiency of the system.

SafetyTip{Take care to anchor the retort stands carefully so that the glass rods are not inadvertently stressed.}

StepHeader{Happens}

The photograph shows one way to set up the equipment that works. If you have a low-friction pulley wheel then hook it over the top glass rod and fix it in place using a small amount of Blu-tack. If the pulley wheel is not so good, you may be better off just using the glass rod itself as a pulley. Arrange it so that the ValueUnit{10}{gram} mass holder falls ValueUnit{30}{centimetre}. Pull the trolley ValueUnit{80}{centimetre} back from the bottom glass rod. Place the light gate ValueUnit{30}{cm} from the bottom glass rod so that when the trolley passes through it the ValueUnit{10}{g} mass has landed on the platform, allowing the fishing line to go slack. As you pull the trolley back, look down the length of the equipment to aim the line of sight of the trolley through the light gate SymbolEndash you don't want to miss.

StepHeader{Opening up the discussion}

TeacherSpeak{Here we have a demonstration where we can calculate energy shifted. There's a small mass of ValueUnit{10}{g}, which will fall when I release it. This is attached to a dynamics trolley by some fishing line. The trolley has very free-wheeling wheels and the bench is very smooth. Why do you think that's important?}

PupilSpeak{Bill}{To minimise the energy wasted by frictional forces on the car wheels.}

TeacherSpeak{Good, but can anyone suggest a clearer idea than just wasted? Neil?}

PupilSpeak{Neil}{Dissipated, Miss&hellip;}

TeacherSpeak{That may be a more helpful description than QuotationThis{wasted}, but can you tell me a bit about the thinking that lies behind it? Yes, Judy&hellip;}

PupilSpeak{Judy}{The energy is spread out, Miss.}

TeacherSpeak{Yes Judy, that's along the right lines. Can you remember where we look for energy?}

PupilSpeak{Sharran}{In stores, Miss. It's always stores.}

TeacherSpeak{Now let's pull our suggestions together. Lower frictional forces result in less energy being shifted to many stores, and more energy being kept in fewer stores. Keep that in mind as we go back to the apparatus. Now, as I let the mass fall like so, you'll see that the trolley will begin to move. Picture the energy being shifted. The gravity store is emptied. Which store is filled?}

PupilSpeak{Jess}{The store to do with movement&hellip; what is it called?}

TeacherSpeak{Yes SymbolEndash the kinetic store. Now this system, as you know, can't be ValueUnit{100}{&percnt;} efficient: not all of the energy is shifted from the gravity store to the kinetic store. We can calculate the energy shifted from the gravity store and the energy shifted to the kinetic store. How can we do this?}

PupilSpeak{Emil}{one store of energy is mass (ValueUnit{0.01}{kilogram})   SymbolMultipliedby  g (ValueUnit{9.8}{metre second-2})   SymbolMultipliedby height (ValueUnit{0.3}{metre}), which is ValueUnit{0.029}{J}, and the other store of energy is FractionBlock{1}{2}   SymbolMultipliedby QuantitySymbol{m} (ValueUnit{0.25}{kg})   SymbolMultipliedby  QuantitySuper{v}{2}.}

TeacherSpeak{Good. Energy is shifted from the gravity store to the kinetic store. But does it all end up there? Yes, Katy?}

PupilSpeak{Katy}{No, Miss, some stuff gets warm.}

TeacherSpeak{Yes. Some energy is shifted to different thermal stores. You can see that the potential energy lost by the mass is easy to find (ValueUnit{0.029}{joule}). The final speed of the trolley once the mass has fallen ValueUnit{30}{cm} is more difficult to find. The way that we'll do it is by using a light gate. You can see that the trolley has a piece of card (ValueUnit{0.135}{m} long) attached to it. When this card passes through the gate, the time taken to do so is recorded. We can then find the speed of the trolley as FractionABC{speed}{distance}{duration}. So FractionABC{speed}{length of the card}{time taken (in seconds)}. In fact, if we let the mass fall three times and then find the average time of the card through the light gate, this would be a more reliable method, so let's do that.}

Now let the mass fall three times and write on the board the potential energy lost by the mass (ValueUnit{0.029}{J}) and the average velocity and average energy in the kinetic store of the trolley.

The time displayed on the light gate will be in millisecond and you should be sure that the students know how to convert milliseconds into seconds (divide by 1000). For the relationship to work the time must be in seconds.

TeacherSpeak{Now we will use these to find the efficiency of this system. EfficiencyCalc{average energy gained by the trolley}{energy lost by the falling mass}.}

(The efficiency from trial data was around ValueUnit{60}{&percnt;}.)

There is at least one other possibility worth exploring SymbolEndash the energy starts in the kinetic store, is shifted to the gravitational store and then returned to the kinetic store. You'll need to adjust the set-up to make the measurements, but it is worth exploring several possibilities as energy is shifted to and fro between the stores.
