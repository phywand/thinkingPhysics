WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- separating the pull of gravity acting on an object from any compression or tension forces supporting the object
- exploring situations where gravity still pulls, but there is no atmosphere
- modelling the action of the pull of gravity as a force
- drawing forces precisely
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- conflating mass and QuoteThis{weight}
- restricting drawing the pull of gravity on objects to situations where these objects are falling
- being casual with the term QuoteThis{weightless}
- stating that a force is zero, when it's only very small

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
