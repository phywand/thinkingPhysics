ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- focus on the physical aspect of the transmission of sound
- build a source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model
- put the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model to use
- make connections with travelling electromagnetic vibrations
- connect vibrating objects to travelling vibrations
- connect hearing to the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- draw the spread of the vibrations
- describe and make real the to and fro vibrations
- prepare the ground for frequency and amplitude being the fundamental characteristics
- draw vibrating objects
- unify a wide range of experiences with a single model

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
