StepHeader{Purpose}

The purpose of this activity is to engage the pupils in making calculations based on levers. These can be hard to do, particularly since they involve four variables.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- two diagrams
- a simple example or two to calculate

StepHeader{Happens}

Talk through what you are doing as you perform a simple calculation, following the logic of the diagram provided:

ListInformation
- Calculate one moment.
- Calculate the opposing moment.
- Compare these two moments.
ListInformationEnd

Here is a second sequence, that reduces the algebraic demand:

ListInformation
- Calculate the change in one energy store.
- Calculate the change in the second energy store.
- Compare these two changes.
ListInformationEnd

This sequence reduces the algebraic demand and in any case emphasises the physics SymbolEndash you cannot get out more than you put in SymbolEndash only go for a trade-off! If you reduce the force, then you'll gain in distance (we can be a bit careless here SymbolEndash similar triangles ensures that this can be either distance moved or length to pivot). We recommend that you are a bit inflexible here, insisting on a clear and clearly reported logic in the calculations. You might emphasise these calculations as a kind of argument. It is not only getting the right answer that matters, but how reliably the evidence supports the case. This is only obvious if you take the trouble to lay out the argument carefully.
