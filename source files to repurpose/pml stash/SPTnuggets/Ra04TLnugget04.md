ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

It is quite common for students to use the three terms QuoteThis{radioactivity}, QuoteThis{radioactive material} and QuoteThis{radiation} interchangeably.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

In addressing this teaching and learning challenge it's not just a matter of QuoteThis{learning new words}. The underlying meanings of the terms need to be developed:

ListInformation
- QuoteThis{Radioactivity} is the general name for the phenomenon. There are parallels here with use of the word QuoteThis{electricity} (See the SPT: Electric circuits topic). Just as electricity does not flow around a circuit, radioactivity is not given out by a radioactive material. In fact (as with electricity), once the term QuoteThis{Radioactivity} has been used as a title for this topic, students will not really need to use it again. Some teachers go so far as to ban its further use.
- The radioactive material is the bulk substance, such as isotopes of uranium, which emits radiation.
- The radiations are often emitted with distinctive properties: alpha, beta and gamma radiations are three that do have such distinctive properties.
