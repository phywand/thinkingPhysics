By providing the speeds in the format of, for example, ValueUnit{10}{metre} in one second, you are laying the foundation for ideas about speed as a measured quantity. The important point here is that you have control over the language used (i.e. distance (metres) moved in ValueUnit{1}{second}.)

The reinforcement of language is important. The teacher can model the language and encourage pupils to use the same form of words in any discussion that may emerge. This is a good time to make a clear link between fastest and slowest and the measured quantity QuoteThis{speed}.
