We have seen from the previous examples of working with levers that the two quantities which need to be taken into account are the size of force acting and the length from the pivot.

More precisely we need to take account of:

ListInformation
- The sizes of the forces acting QuantitySub{F}{1} and QuantitySub{F}{2}
- The perpendicular lengths between the line of action of each force and the pivot point QuantitySub{L}{1} and QuantitySub{L}{2}
ListInformationEnd

The QuoteThis{line of action of a force} is exactly what the name suggests: The direction or line along which the force acts. In the diagram, QuantitySub{F}{1} acts along a line vertically upwards: so does QuantitySub{F}{2} SymbolEndash but along a different line.

Both of the forces QuantitySub{F}{1} and QuantitySub{F}{2} produce a turning effect on the lever:

ListInformation
- QuantitySub{F}{1} tends to turn the lever in a clockwise direction.
- QuantitySub{F}{2} tends to turn the lever in an anti-clockwise direction.
ListInformationEnd

The size of these turning effects can be calculated.

StepHeader{Calculating turning effects}

Here's a precise way of writing it out, so that every term is just a number:

FractionAdBeqCDdEF{turning effect}{newton metre}{perpendicular length}{metre}{force}{newton}

You can also express it rather concisely as:

ProductABC{turning effect}{perpendicular length}{force}

StepHeader{The moment}

InsertGraphic{MaBalancedLeversIPCC}

The turning effect is called the moment of the force and is measured in newton metres.

For the example given above (given that the lever is balanced): EqualityAssertion{clockwise moment}{anti-clockwise moment}, so ProductABeqCD{QuantitySub{L}{1}}{QuantitySub{F}{1}}{QuantitySub{L}{2}}{QuantitySub{F}{2}}.

This law of balancing actually follows from the principle of conservation of energy.
