- giving time to exploring the idea of a QuoteThis{natural motion}
- giving physical experiences of motion in a circle
- explicitly modelling the two dimensional motion, if you go that far
- building up to the idea of an orbit, from thrown objects, gradually increasing the launch speed

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- conflating the launching of a satellite with is orbiting
- restricting the discussion of satellites to artificial satellites
- QuoteThis{centrifugal force}
