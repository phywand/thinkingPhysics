Dan Smolski: American footballer and astronaut

Dan Smolski played American football at high school. He was always chosen for the school team because he was so difficult to tackle on account of his size. Dan was big for his age. At age 15 Dan weighed ValueUnit{700}{newton}.

His height and broad shoulders made him as big as the PE teacher. They both had a mass of about ValueUnit{70}{kilogram} and Dan's mass has not changed to this very day.

After studying mathematics at university, Dan joined the US Marines and eventually Dan was selected for special astronaut training. He had always wanted to travel into space.

Dan landed on the Moon in 2025 and became one of the first members of the Moon Marauders American football team, which plays all of its games in the special lunar astrodome constructed in 2021.
