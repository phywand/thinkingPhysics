Calculations of certain energy changes may not be possible at the time that you'd first want to analyse what's possible and what's not possible in terms of energy. The quantity of energy shifted to or from a store stands for a calculation that is possible, not too far in the pupil's future. Indicating the change of energy in a store between one time and another is the essence of developing this pre-cursor description, that will later become fully qualitative (here it is necessarily only semi-quantitative).

Requiring that a physical description is well-established before attempting an energy description is essential to establishing a well-founded representation of the process in energetic terms.
