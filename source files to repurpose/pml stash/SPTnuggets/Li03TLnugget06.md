WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- linking reflection to the act of seeing all non-luminous objects
- exploring the phenomenon of refraction through many different examples
- developing more complex examples on the foundations of an account of the simple phenomena
- making some real measurements of angles, emphasising skilful practice
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- restricting examples of reflection to only, or mostly, shiny surfaces
- replacing experiences of real  and interesting phenomena with a series of ad-hoc memorised rules
- not showing how an understanding of simple situations is linked to a wide variety of phenomena in the lived-in world

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
