WebTitle{Measuring currents in a parallel circuit(Activity)}

StepHeader{Taking measurements}

StepHeader{Purpose}

This practical activity offers pupils the opportunity to build a simple parallel circuit and to take current measurements at various points around the circuit. The intention is to enable pupils to strengthen their understanding of how parallel circuits work.

StepHeader{Happens}

Pupils work in pairs to build a parallel circuit and to measure the current in the leads to and from the battery and through each of the bulbs.

Some pupils will benefit from large scale drawings of the circuits, so that they can place the physical elements directly on the drawings and so work out where to place the ammeters.
