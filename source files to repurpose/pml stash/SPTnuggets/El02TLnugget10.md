WebTitle{Keep emphasising charge is in the wires already(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{Don't use a model that suggests charged particles come from the battery}

It's very easy to say;

TeacherSpeak{a current of ValueUnit{1.4}{ampere} flows from the supply}

or

TeacherSpeak{a current of ValueUnit{1.4}{ampere} is drawn from the supply}.

Once again these words imply that the current originates in the battery and it is better to say something like

TeacherTip{There is a current of ValueUnit{1.4}{ampere} in the wires of the big loop and in the supply.}
