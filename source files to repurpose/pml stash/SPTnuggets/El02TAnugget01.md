WebTitle{Adding batteries to the circuit(Activity)}

StepHeader{Part 1: what happens on adding a battery?}

StepHeader{Purpose}

Throughout this practical activity, the pupils will establish that when an extra battery is added to a simple electric circuit, the current around the circuit increases in value and the bulb gets brighter; or the buzzer/bell sounds louder; or the motor turns more quickly.

StepHeader{Happens}

The pupils work in pairs to measure the current in the bulb circuit and buzzer/bell/motor circuit with one, two and possibly three batteries and observe what happens.

StepHeader{Part 2: how to explain what happens}

StepHeader{Purpose}

The pupils are encouraged to talk and think about the electric circuit model and a teaching model to account for what they have found with the various electric circuits.

StepHeader{Happens}

The pupils work in pairs to talk through their ideas to explain why the bulb is brighter (the buzzer/bell louder) and the current is bigger when a second cell is added. Pairs then report back during class discussion.
