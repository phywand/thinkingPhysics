Would you expect children at age 11 to know that the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west? Many do not. Without this knowledge, much of the discussion about seasons or explanations for day and night will be lost on pupils.

Even fewer pupils are likely to have much idea of the variation between the winter Sun and the summer Sun in terms of the angle that the Sun reaches above the horizon (which is bigger in the summer as the Sun is higher in the sky).

So these kinds of ideas, and the material that the pupils have covered at primary school are worth probing initially with some kind of diagnostic test.

We asked a group of 11-year-old pupils the following questions:

What causes day and night?

The Earth, Sun and Moon, which is the largest?

Why is it hotter in the summer?

In the video clips they speak for themselves.

Given the kinds of learning difficulties experienced by pupils especially in relation to QuoteThis{phases of the Moon} and QuoteThis{seasons}, we believe that it is important not to teach these topics early on in the sequence as is sometimes recommended.

We suggest that you begin by exploring what there is in the solar system and its origins, so following the sequence of these materials.

Much of this work is engaging, descriptive and relatively simple so it should not be too taxing. You can then build up to exploring the scientific explanation for the seasons and the phases of the Moon, which need time and careful elaboration.
