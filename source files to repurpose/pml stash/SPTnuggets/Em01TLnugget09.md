StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- using an explicit model of permanent magnets
- being consistent in the drawing of force arrows
- giving children a variety of representations to hand when asking for descriptions
- explicitly modelling the drawing of magnetic fields
- explaining the interpretation of magnetic field diagrams SymbolEndash  and why field diagrams are important
- speaking, acting and drawing with exemplary precision, so children can apprentice their practice on yours
- giving extensive first-hand, physical, experience of the forces between magnets
- explicitly modelling the replacement of an interaction with a force, by isolating one magnet from its environment
- exploiting the sensations of action-at-a-distance in your own hands
- explicitly introducing the purposes of the field idea at the same time as the idea
- moving from QuoteThis{north-seeking pole} to QuoteThis{north pole}
- using the mini-magnets representation to support predictions

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- relying too much on precise words by themselves
- acting as if the drawing of magnetic fields is obvious
- referring to gravitational, electrical and magnetic effects without taking great care to separate them
- linking the atmosphere to mediating either gravitational or magnetic forces
- assuming that action-at-a-distance is not problematic
