StepHeader{Practical limitations on electric motors are related to energy and to power}

What's the big drawback to using electric motors in cars? This is a question worth addressing with students and it provides a further opportunity to practise a simple QuoteThis{power in pathways} calculation.

The BMW Mini E has an electric motor rated at ValueUnit{150}{kW}.

TeacherSpeak{Can you explain what QuoteThis{rated at ValueUnit{150}{kW} tells us about the motor of the car}?}

PupilSpeak{Martha}{The power of the Mini is ValueUnit{150}{kW}.}

TeacherSpeak{There's more to it&hellip;}

PupilSpeak{Martha}{The maximum possible power is 150 kW.}

TeacherSpeak{Yes, that's it! When the Mini is moving at its top speed the electrical store of the battery is being emptied at a rate of ValueUnit{150,000}{J} each second. So if the battery stores about ValueUnit{100,000}{kJ} how can we calculate how long the car will run for at this top steady speed?}

PupilSpeak{Az}{Divide ValueUnit{100,000}{kilojoule} by ValueUnit{150,000}{joule / second}.}

TeacherSpeak{That's exactly right, and if we do the calculation it comes to&hellip; <br> FractionBlock{100 000 joule}{150 000 joule / second} &hellip; ValueUnit{667}{second}&hellip;  just over 11 minutes.}

The message from the calculation is clear: the car doesn't run for long at top speed before needing a recharge.
