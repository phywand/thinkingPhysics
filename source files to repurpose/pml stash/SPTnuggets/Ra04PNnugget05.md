Energy is measured in joule SymbolEndash except when it's not. For historical reasons there are a number of other measures of energy for ionising radiations. Foremost among them is the electron-volt.

You'll often find the energies of, say, alpha particles measured in mega electron volt (MeV).

Electrons have a charge. The SPT: Electricity and energy topic shows how to calculate the energy shifted by a charge moving through a potential difference.

ProductABC{energy shifted}{charge}{potential difference}

1 electron-volt is ValueExponent{1.6}{-19}{joule}

1 MeV is ValueExponent{1.6}{-13}{joule}.

Here we'll prefer joule. Alpha radiations from a particular source are mono-energetic: they are all emitted with a single energy.

Here are a sample range of values, for emissions from different nuclei: WordSub{U}{235}, ValueUnit{706.4}{femtojoule} ; WordSub{Ra}{225}, ValueUnit{713.6}{femtojoule} ; WordSub{Hf}{174}, ValueUnit{400.0}{femtojoule} . (These are quoted in femtojoules, where 1 femtojoule is ValueExponent{1.6}{-15}{joule}.)
