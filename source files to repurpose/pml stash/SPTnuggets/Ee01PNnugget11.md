Circuits with only one parallel connection are best analysed by thinking of the two separate loops that make up the circuit. The introduction to parallel connections in circuits was made in this way in the SPT: Electric circuits topic. The loops have nothing in common, other than the battery, so you can treat them as two separate loops.

Then simply use the relationship

FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}

for each loop to find the current in each. The potential difference and the resistance in the loop together set the current in each loop. The current in the battery is the sum of the current in each of the loops, as the battery is in both loops. The interactive keeps things very simple because the two arms of the parallel circuit are identical.
