ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- relate your model of flow to actions in adding elements to a loop
- relate your model of flow to actions in adding loops
- connect toolkits for thinking with physical experiences with circuits
- not conflate analogies with toolkits that can make predictions
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- keep emphasising that the charged particles are only set in motion by the battery
- separate charge flow and energy shifting
- exploit your chosen toolkit to make predictions about the effects of changes to circuits
- keep the focus on whole loops
- link the ideas of something being used up to the flattening of the battery

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
