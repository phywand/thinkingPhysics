In our experience, students often confuse the terms, QuoteThis{refraction} and QuoteThis{diffraction}. With this in mind it's useful to practice the following QuoteThis{mantra}:

TeacherSpeak{So! Let's just remind ourselves, what's the difference between refraction and diffraction of light?}

PupilSpeak{Esme}{Refraction's bending, diffraction's spreading.}

TeacherSpeak{Exactly! Refraction involves the bending of light at some interface between two media, such as air and glass. Diffraction involves the spreading of light around a barrier or through a gap.}

TeacherTip{Bend a beam SymbolArrowright refraction.}

TeacherTip{Spread a beam SymbolArrowright diffraction.}
