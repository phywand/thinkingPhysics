WrongTrack{How can there be pressure inside gases? They're too thin, they're not like water.}

RightLines{The air around us has a pressure just like water. This air pressure is due to the bombardment of air molecules. We don't notice air pressure until air is removed from one side of a surface (remove air from a Coke can and the air on the outside crushes the walls inwards).}

StepHeader{Starting with liquids}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Pupils will readily accept the idea of pressure existing in liquids because it is a familiar phenomenon. However they may have problems in accepting that gases, such as the air around them, exert pressures.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Given that pupils are more familiar with pressure in liquids we recommend that you start with examples involving liquids and then move on to gases.
