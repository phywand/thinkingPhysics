WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- treating empirical relationships with respect
- treating the reimagining of natural motion as if it's problematic
- dealing with action at a distance respectfully
- using resultant force to predict motion
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- speaking as if force is the kind of thing that gets carried
- being careless about scalars and vectors
- speaking of forces trying to do things
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
