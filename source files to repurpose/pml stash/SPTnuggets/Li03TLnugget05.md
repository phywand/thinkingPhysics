StepHeader{A teaching anecdote}

We're sure you'll find a story like this one to share with your class.

I was out walking with a friend when we came to a stream which was pretty wide (about ValueUnit{10}{metre}). It had been raining quite a bit in the previous few days and the stream looked full. I wasn't too sure about whether we could cross here. Perhaps we should look for an easier place farther down-stream. My friend would have nothing of it. QuoteThis{It doesn't look too deep to me. I'm going to take my boots off, roll my trousers up and wade across}. And so he did. In the very first step he lowered himself into the water from the bank, slipped and found himself almost waist deep in the stream.

I could feel an explanation about refraction, plus real and apparent depths coming on, but couldn't manage it through my laughter.
