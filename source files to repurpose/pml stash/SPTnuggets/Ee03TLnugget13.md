StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- developing physical descriptions before accounts that use energy and power
- using apparatus, words and diagrams together to develop accounts
- emphasising the practical consequences of calculations with power and energy
- putting new theoretical ideas to work to imbue them with meaning
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- replacing the physical arguments with mnemonics
- arguing about power and energy without quantifying
- conflating different steps of multistep arguments
- not making links between different devices, all of which switch power
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
