QuoteThis{A car travelling at 60 must be going faster than a car travelling at 40.}

This kind of statement is very common and reflects what we see around us. Speed limit signs are QuoteThis{30} or QuoteThis{50} with no attention paid to units.

Of course bigger numbers give a QuoteThis{bigger} message. A younger child offered the choice between 100 pence or one pound might be seduced by the larger number of pence into thinking that it was somehow worth more. In this example, pence and pounds are examples of two different units of measurement. There is a conversion factor between them (100 p is Â£1).

And so it is with speed. However, in the ValueUnit{60}{kilometre / hour} and 40 mph example it is not altogether obvious which of the two speeds mentioned above is greater. In fact they are almost the same speed, quoted in different ways.

QuoteThis{A car travelling at ValueUnit{60}{kilometre / hour} will be going faster than a car travelling at ValueUnit{40}{kilometre / hour}.}

However, a car travelling at ValueUnit{60}{kilometre / hour} is not going faster than a car travelling at 40 mph. It is important that children realise from the outset the importance of specifying units, so that comparisons can be made. Numbers on their own are meaningless.

To illustrate this in another context, imagine that you were told that John is 1420, Max is 150 and Ian is 1.6 tall. Is John the tallest?

Including the units we see that if John is ValueUnit{1420}{millimetre}, Max is ValueUnit{150}{centimetre} and Ian is ValueUnit{1.6}{metre} tall, then Ian is the tallest. Mathematics often concentrates on numbers and relationships between numbers. Science rarely deals with pure numbers but with quantities. A quantity is a number multiplied by a unit. For example 56 is a number but ValueUnit{56}{metre / second} is a quantity. An education in science must make this distinction in a formal sense. This will not be the first time that children have met the challenge of different units. One approach is to ensure that most examples given to children are quoted in metres and seconds in the first instance. Hence try to avoid early questions which have objects moving at speeds such as ValueUnit{22}{millimetre / second} or ValueUnit{47}{kilometre / hour}. It is far better to use examples such as people walking at ValueUnit{3}{metre / second} or cars travelling at ValueUnit{12}{metre / second} or sound travelling at ValueUnit{330}{metre / second}.
