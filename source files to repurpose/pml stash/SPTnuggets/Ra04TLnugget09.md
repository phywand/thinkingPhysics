When observing demonstrations with radioactive sources and a Geiger&ndash;Müller tube, students are likely to associate a high rate of counting with a high level of QuoteThis{danger} from a source.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

The rate of counting of the Geiger&ndash;Müller tube is not a direct measure of the potential danger of a source. For example, it could be that the high rate of counting is due to a high-activity beta source that, in fact, has a less harmful effect at close range on human tissue than an alpha source of similar activity. Thus if both sources were swallowed or breathed in, the highly ionising alpha source would be much more dangerous. The beta source is releasing electrons at a high rate but these have a smaller damaging effect on human tissue. So, you can't tell simply by the rate of clicking of a Geiger&ndash;Müller tube how dangerous a radioactive source is.
