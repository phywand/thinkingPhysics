ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

Teaching and learning about light involves using familiar words in specialist ways. For example: QuoteThis{source} means where light comes from; QuoteThis{object} means the thing that is being looked at; QuoteThis{medium} means the QuoteThis{background} through which light travels, whether it be a vacuum, air, water, or glass.

Using these terms allows you to talk in general ways about systems involving light. For example, it doesn't matter whether you are looking at a car, a book or an elephant, you can simply refer to it as the object.

Rather than just dropping these words into your teaching it is worth drawing pupils' attention to their usage.

TeacherTip{Make the introduction and utility of technical terms an explicit part of the learning.}
