ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- keep amplitude and frequency separate, each with their own vocabulary
- separate the to and fro movement of the particles that forms the vibration from the propagation of the vibration, which is also a movement
- explore the range of hearing, along both the amplitude and frequency axes
- connect human hearing to what other species can hear
- ensure that the need for particles as a medium is always there
- link each sound heard back to the source, via the medium

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}

ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- reinforce the source&ndash;medium&ndash;detector model
- represent the vibrations of the source
- represent the vibrations in the medium
- represent the vibrations of the detector
- account for reductions in intensity with distance from the source
- link delays in hearing sounds to the trip time of propagation from the source
- show sounds travelling through solids and liquids, as well as gases
- measure the frequency of a sound
- measure the amplitude of a sound

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
