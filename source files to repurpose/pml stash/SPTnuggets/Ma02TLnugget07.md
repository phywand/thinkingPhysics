Almost any example that has one solid resting on another will tend to lead to thinking leading along the Wrong Tracks.

Using pressure ideas to explain the behaviour of solids is so commonplace that you really need to decide as a science department on the approach that you will take (otherwise it will certainly be confusing for pupils). There is no doubt at all that the approach which we have set out here is the sensible and correct one from a physics point of view.
