You could, of course, prepare your own, either by drawing over a phtograph, or by using cardboard arrows, or using software that allows arrows of defined length, colour and direction to be placed over an image.

Faster groups, or those revisiting the topic for revision, could be invited to make up their own examples using whichever tool you have made available.
