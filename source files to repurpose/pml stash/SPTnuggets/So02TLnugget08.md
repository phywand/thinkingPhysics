WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- showing large-scale, slow vibrations producing a sound
- emphasising that all sounds have a source
- tracing the chain from source to detector, via medium, often
- showing changing frequency without changing amplitude
- showing changing amplitude without changing frequency
- measuring frequency directly, linking this to counting the vibrations
- relating delays in hearing sounds to trip times due to the speed of propagation

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- showing waveforms on an oscilloscope
- introducing wavelength prematurely
- using a strobe without explaining how you see what you see

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
