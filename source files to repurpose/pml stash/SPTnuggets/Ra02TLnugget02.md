In episode 01, QuoteThis{Radiating from source to absorber}, a description was developed of light and sound as originating in vibrations that travel from a source as electromagnetic and mechanical waves. This picture of light and sound waves will be a familiar one to students, not just from studies of science in school but also through common usage of these terms in everyday life.

In this episode, we shall be asking the students to take a fascinating and challenging step forward in their learning. This involves coming to accept that light does not shift energy in a steady stream but in tiny, discrete units, or QuoteThis{chunks}.
