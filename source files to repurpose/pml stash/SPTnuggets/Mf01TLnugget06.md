A key step on the journey is to move away from thinking that objects fall because they are heavy. In other words, believing that it&apos;s something within the object (its heaviness) that makes it fall. The Newtonian view is that objects fall because of the action of the external gravitational pull of the Earth.

A possible activity is to set the children the challenge of QuoteThis{battling the pull of gravity}. This involves taking the class to the school gymnasium and getting volunteers (there&apos;s never a shortage) to hang from a horizontal bar so that their feet are just clear of the ground. You can then time how long each can QuoteThis{withstand the pull of gravity}.

The idea here is to set up a situation where the children can get the idea (and feel) that gravity is pulling them down towards the centre of the Earth. It is always a memorable lesson as you encourage the children to QuoteThis{battle against the pull of gravity} and ask QuoteThis{can you feel the pull of the Earth?}.

Interestingly, its often the little, thin children who can withstand the pull of gravity the longest, with the more likely QuoteThis{stronger} boys struggling against the larger gravitational pull on their greater masses.
