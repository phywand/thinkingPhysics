Introducing the idea of voltage and voltage measurement with a voltmeter can create confusions for pupils who tend to mix them up with existing ideas about electric current. The fact that ammeters and voltmeters look just the same can add to this confusion.

It is a good idea to explicitly refer to the QuoteThis{two stories} which can be drawn upon in thinking and talking about electric circuits. These two stories are:

- The charge/electric current story.
- The power/voltage story.

Referring to the two sets of ideas in this way can help pupils to see the difference between them.
