ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- organise what pupils have observed into a coherent whole
- build three-dimension models where illumination is important
- draw out what children believe about the Earth-Moon-Sun system and how this is related to everyday phenomena
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- build a sequence that uses increasingly complex models
- keep each step of the simplification in building the models connected with the whole
- distinguish between spinning on an axis and orbiting another object
- keep what is noticed and recorded somewhat separate from what is modelled
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
