TeacherTip{Take care how you use words, so that you don't say things that a moment's thought would reveal to be false.}

For example, the owners of this gate meant QuoteThis{regular} or perhaps QuoteThis{frequent}.

It turns out that they certainly did not mean constant, unless the photograph lies. In the same way, we'd suggest that you don't use QuoteThis{steady}, or other near synonyms, to mean QuoteThis{constant}.

We'd suggest that you restrict the use of the word QuoteThis{constant} to mean having the same value at all times, and don't use synonyms for the word. So:

TeacherSpeak{The speed is constant.}

TeacherSpeak{The acceleration is constant.}

But not:

TeacherSpeak{The speed was steady.}

TeacherSpeak{It's a steady force.}
