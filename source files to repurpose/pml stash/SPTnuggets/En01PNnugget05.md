Let's think about making a pot of tea. Boiling enough water for a pot of tea takes ValueUnit{180}{second} with my kettle. The kettle is marked  ValueUnit{3.0}{kilowatt}, which means that it costs me ValueUnit{3000}{joule} every second to run the kettle. To boil the kettle, I must therefore pay the electricity board for ValueUnit{3000}{joule / second}   SymbolMultipliedby  ValueUnit{180}{second} which can be worked out to be  ValueUnit{540,000}{joule}. Other domestic appliances cost me different numbers of joules, as they work at different rates for different lengths of time. Some are high power, but work only for a short time (cooker, kettle). Others are lower power, but work more or less continuously (refrigerator) or for long periods of time (lighting).

Here are some typical annual costs:

To find out how much energy each appliance uses, simply keep a log of how long you run it for (time in second SymbolEndash the duration), then multiply this quantity by the power of the appliance (power in watt).

Of course the averages given above vary with lifestyle and occupancy. Here are some estimates of how the annual total energy per household might vary:
