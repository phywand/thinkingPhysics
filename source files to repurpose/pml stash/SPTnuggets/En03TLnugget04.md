Pathways describe the ways in which energy is shifting into and out of stores as they are being filled and emptied. The pathway allows us to think about accumulations of energy that has been shifted (or the rate at which the energy is shifting) and tells us a little about the mechanism by which this occurs.

There is a clear difference between energy stores and pathways and this needs to be emphasised in your teaching. Consider the example of stretching a rubber band:

Here the elastic store associated with the band is filled by mechanical working (the pathway) as you pull on the band.

The full energy story is told using both stores and pathways.
