StepHeader{A car travelling on the motorway at constant speed SymbolEndash what else?}

WrongTrack{That car is travelling along the motorway, so it's kinetic store must be changing.}

RightLines{The car is travelling at constant speed. The energy in the kinetic store only changes if there is a change in speed. There is no change in speed, so we do not need to concern ourselves with a kinetic store.}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

 It is all too easy to make descriptions more complicated than they need to be. The idea with energy is to develop a simple abstract description that gives us an overview. So here comes eraser is all important SymbolEndash do not include anything that is not essential or useful. To be useful it needs to be possible to calculate a change in the energy in a store.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

 In dynamic equilibria, there may be many changes, but some things will be constant. One of the things which may be constant is the energy in a store. Keep an special eye out for these stores, so that you do not include them in any description of the energy in the stores for the initial or for the final snapshot.

 The case of something moving at constant speed is one such example which is commonly used. But there are others SymbolEndash for example, if an animal is simply maintaining its body mass then the energy in the chemical store associated with that biomass does not change. There are other changes and these are important: the chemical store associated with the foodstuff that the animal consumes will be depleted; the chemical store associated the detritus excreted by that animal will also change; the thermal store associated with the environment will also change, as the animal warms its environment.
 
TeacherTip{Think about a living, grown hen  as being like a car journey from Hatfield to Birmingham. Start point: yesterday; end point: today. In both cases, a chemical store is emptied and the internal store of  the environment is filled up. The chemical store of the hen is constant and not relevant to the calculation: nor is the energy in the kinetic store associated with the car.}

TeacherTip{Growing a hen from a fertilised egg  is altogether different. Now, of course, a chemical store  associated with the hen does get filled.  As does the internal store  associated with the environment and the chemical store of the detritus. The chemical store of the hen  is measured in biology as the biomass. (If you're focusing on a biological description, from this point onwards, it seems  closer to the physical realities not to mention energy but just refer to biomass.)}
