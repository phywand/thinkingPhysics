As smaller potential differences seem safer, why not use them? Why not have mains wiring at ValueUnit{12}{volt} throughout the house, rather than ValueUnit{230}{volt}? And why shift energy around the country using ValueUnit{11}{kilovolt}, ValueUnit{110}{kilovolt} and even ValueUnit{400}{kV} transmission lines? After all, damp skin and ValueUnit{230}{V} are best kept apart, as explained in episode 01.

Here we'll build a simple model of a circuit, using what you have learnt about working in series circuits to explain why large-voltage, small-current pathways are better suited to shifting large quantities of energy than small-voltage, large-current pathways. The character of the different pathways determines their possible uses, even though the power in both pathways may be identical.

For domestic distribution, we already know that ValueUnit{230}{volt} is an upper limit, chosen so that lethal currents are not, in normal circumstances, driven through people. The key question here is why a smaller potential difference is not used. For longâ€“range distribution, from power station to town, why use anything greater than ValueUnit{230}{volt}, if that is the final required potential difference? The answers are linked, and the simple model used illuminates some of the factors to be considered in engineering a system to shift energy from one store to another store, often very remote from the first, using electrical pathways of different characters.

Here you can do calculations using the simple model. These support an account, using the understanding of series circuits developed in episode 01, to explain how some electrical pathways work better than others for shifting energy where you want it.
