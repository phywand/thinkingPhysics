WebTitle{Selecting and developing activities(Suggestions)}

TeacherTip{Based on the Physics Narrative and the Teaching and Learning Issues}

ThinkHeader{Ideas to emphasise here}

ListInformation
- the physical aspect of the transmission of sound
- the source-medium-detector model
- the spreading of the vibrations
- the to and fro vibrations
- prepare the ground for frequency and amplitude being the fundamental characteristics
- vibrating objects, as sources and detectors
- reinforce the source-medium-detector model
- represent the vibrations of the source
- represent the vibrations in the medium
- represent The vibrations of the detector
- account for reductions in intensity with distance from the source
- link delays in hearing sounds to the trip time of propagation from the source
- show sounds travelling through solids and liquids, as well as gases

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Strategies for supporting learning}

ListInformation
- put the source-medium-detector model to use
- connect vibrating objects to travelling vibrations
- connect hearing to the source-medium-detector model
- separate the to and fro movement of the particles that forms the vibration from the propagation of the vibration, which is also a movement
- showing large-scale, slow vibrations producing a sound
- emphasising that all sounds have a source
- tracing the chain from source to detector, via medium, often
- explore the range of hearing, along both the amplitude and frequency axes
- connect human hearing to what other species can hear
- ensure that the need for particles as a medium is always there
- link each sound heard back to the source, via the medium

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children&apos;s ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- using specious energy descriptions
- drawing or showing transverse waveforms
- asserting that sound is a wave without clarifying explanation of the idea of a wave SymbolEndash this is hard
- showing waveforms on an oscilloscope or computer
- introducing wavelength
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
