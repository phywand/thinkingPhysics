With the bottle opener you:

push down with a EmphasiseThis{small} force (your effort)
&hellip; through a EmphasiseThis{large} distance.

This results in:

a EmphasiseThis{large} upward force of the lever on the cap
&hellip; acting through a EmphasiseThis{small} distance.

The whole point of the bottle opener is to produce a EmphasiseThis{big} force from a EmphasiseThis{small} force, but the drawback is that you must push through a big distance. Devices such as this are sometimes called force multipliers.
