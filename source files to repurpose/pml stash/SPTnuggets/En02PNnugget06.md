WebTitle{A limited number of stores(Exposition)}

StepHeader{A carefully chosen selection}

The good news about describing the world in terms of energy stores is that there are a limited number of stores to think about. Here is a selection of stores, with those that might be used earlier listed first. In each case that there is more of less energy in a store is a semi-quantitative description, standing in for a useful calculation that can be done.

Imagine a car travelling down the road, the amount of energy in the energy store (in this case a chemical store) decreases. As changes occur, it is often the case that energy stores are filled or emptied.

It is best not to think of a store as empty or full SymbolEndash just as augmented or depleted during processes. Augmenting and depleting stores may be a precise way of expressing matters, but we'd be surprised to find this language being useful in classrooms. So it is better to talk in terms of increasing or decreasing the energy in a store, of filling up and emptying the store.

You'll need to become familiar with these, paying particular attention to identifying physical clues in a process suggesting changes in the quantity of energy in a particular store.

But how do you tell if the store is being filled or emptied during a process?
