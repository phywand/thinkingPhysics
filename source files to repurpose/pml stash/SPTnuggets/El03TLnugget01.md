StepHeader{Bringing together two sets of constraints}

ThinkHeader{Focusing on the learners:}

Distinguishing&ndash;eliciting&ndash;connecting. How to:

ListInformation
- keep ideas of power, energy, charge and current separate
- connect the calculations to everyday concerns
- emphasise differences between current and voltage measurements
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children's ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far. }
ThinkHeader{Focusing on the physics:}

Representing&ndash;noticing&ndash;recording. How to:

ListInformation
- use the idea of voltage, rather than getting stuck on explaining the idea
- be clear and consistent about your use of prepositions
- relate calculations back to physical changes in loops
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Connecting what is experienced with what is written and drawn is essential to making sense of the connections between the theoretical world of physics and the lived-in world of the children. Don't forget to exemplify this action.}
