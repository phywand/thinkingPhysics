WebTitle{Complementary descriptions(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{Move between descriptions}

Students ought to be developing a repertoire of descriptions for objects in motion, and relating changes in these motions to the forces acting on the objects.

Measures of motion:

EqualityAssertion{ SymbolDelta energy in the kinetic store}{FractionBlock{1}{2}QuantitySymbol{m}QuantitySuper{v}{2}}

ProductABC{VectorOver{p}}{QuantitySymbol{m}}{VectorOver{v}}

Changing the motion:

ProductABC{ SymbolDelta VectorOver{p}}{VectorOver{F}}{ SymbolDelta QuantitySymbol{t}}

ProductABC{ SymbolDelta (energy in kinetic store)}{force}{distance}

FractionABC{VectorOver{a}}{VectorOver{F}}{mass}

TeacherTip{Practice translating from one representation to another, using the different measures of motion and changes in motion (momentum, mass, acceleration), and using different modes of representation for these different quantities (verbal, algebraic, graphical, and diagrammatic).}
