This a part of a suggested sequence:

InsertLinkTA{A repertoire to develop the idea of seeing}{Sl01TA.html#01}

StepHeader{Purpose}

This activity focuses on the idea that light travels in straight lines and this behaviour causes shadows.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- several pieces of cardboard of different shapes
- a torch
- a screen or plain wall
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Start with a piece of cardboard SymbolEndash shine a torch at the cardboard and ask the children to look what happens on the wall, and between the cardboard and the wall.

Questions to investigate:

TeacherSpeak{Does the size of the shadow depend upon where the torch shines from?}

TeacherSpeak{How dark is the shadow?  Is it the same darkness everywhere behind the card?}

TeacherSpeak{What happens if you make a hole in the card?}

A possible extension that links with the next episode is to place a stick in the ground outside. Ask children to record the length of the stick&apos;s shadow at the same time of day, on different days of the year.
