StepHeader{Happens}

Choose three different sites around the school for the children to visit. Spend two or three minutes listening carefully to the different sounds at that site. Discuss what you notice about the sounds and make a record, either as a whole group or in small groups.

Here are some useful questions to help direct thinking:

TeacherSpeak{What sounds can you hear?}

TeacherSpeak{Do you think what you&apos;re hearing is close to you or far away?}

TeacherSpeak{Can you give a reason why you think what you&apos;re hearing is close to you or far away from you, even if you close your eyes?}

TeacherSpeak{Can you see what is making the noises?}

TeacherSpeak{How do you think the sound would change if you heard it indoors, say in the classroom?}

TeacherTip{This activity can be repeated beyond the school grounds, on other visits or on a specific local walk, or regularly on QuoteThis{welly walks}.}
