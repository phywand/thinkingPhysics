The questions might be used for homework or as the basis for discussion in class.

The QuoteThis{Electric current at points} question asks about the relative size of the electric current at two points on either side of a bulb. Some pupils may think that the bulb must use up some of the current.

CharList
- The electric current is the same at a and b.
- The current is the same all round the circuit.
EndList

The QuoteThis{Battery and bulb} question probes pupils' ideas about what is happening (unseen) inside the wires of a circuit.

CharList
- There is an electric current in wire B from the bulb to the battery.
- The current in wire B is the same as in wire A.
EndList

The QuoteThis{Current motor} question asks about the relative size of the electric current at two points on either side of a motor. Some pupils may think that a motor must use up some current (even if they think a bulb would not).

CharList
- The reading on ammeter A2 is exactly ValueUnit{0.4}{ampere}.
- The current is the same all around the circuit.
EndList
