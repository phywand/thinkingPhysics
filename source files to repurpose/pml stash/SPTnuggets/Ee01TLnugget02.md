This episode builds on the SPT: Electric circuits topic, focusing on current in a single electrical loop. 

As students move into 14&ndash;16 study they will have been exposed to a significant amount of teaching about electric circuits during their experiences 11&ndash;14, and even before that. This is not to say (unfortunately!) that they will have a full understanding of the ideas that they covered earlier.

In returning to work on electric circuits with the 14&ndash;16 age group, it is therefore very valuable to set a selection of short diagnostic questions for your students, to find out what they still understand from earlier studies and to help them to start thinking once again about electric circuits.
