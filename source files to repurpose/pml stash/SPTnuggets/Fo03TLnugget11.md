StepHeader{Evolving ideas of gravity}

Here is an opportunity to demonstrate to pupils that scientific concepts are the products of the scientific community and therefore may evolve with time.

Aristotle suggested things fell to Earth because it was their QuoteThis{natural place}.

For Newton there were invisible threads linking all objects together.

A totally different approach was suggested by Einstein. He linked gravity to a distortion in the shape of space itself.

A current speculative idea is that invisible QuoteThis{exchange particles} called gravitons pass between all objects and that these somehow are responsible for transmitting the gravitational force effect.

Physics never stands still.
