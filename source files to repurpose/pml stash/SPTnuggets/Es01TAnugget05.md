StepHeader{Purpose}

The aim is to provide a framework to discuss the two effects that mass has on acceleration when something falls.

StepHeader{Prepare} 

ListEquipment
- the modelling program VnR

This file shows how the model is built, and will help you to prepare your support for children thinking through their own constructions.

StepHeader{Happens}

Using VnR, build up a model like this one. Probably you'll want to have a couple of masses to hand SymbolEndash ValueUnit{1}{kilogram} and ValueUnit{5}{kilogram} SymbolEndash to use to prompt questions, so making the whole experience more interactive for the class than is possible with this clip, which just lays out the argument.
