WebTitle{Building a model of the solar system with paper discs(Activity)}

StepHeader{A scale model using paper discs}

StepHeader{Purpose}

Here you construct a model of the solar system to show the relative size of the planets, the distance of each planet from the Sun and the spacing between the planets.

You can remind pupils that scientists frequently build models if the objects they are studying are either unimaginably large or too small to see.

StepHeader{Happens}

Ask the pupils to make up circular discs drawn to scale to represent each planet, one group per planet.

The planets can then either be pinned or hung from the correct position on the string.

TeacherTip{In these modelling activities it is important to be aware that the scale for the size of the planets is not the same scale as that used for the distance between them (although both the relative sizes and relative distances are to scale). If the scales were the same, the object representing Pluto would be about  ValueUnit{1.2}{kilometre} from the Sun.}
