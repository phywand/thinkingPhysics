WrongTrack{We covered  ValueUnit{15}{kilometre} on our ride in 2 hours so we must have been travelling at  ValueUnit{7.5}{kilometre / hour}.}

RightLines{The average speed is calculated from FractionBlock{distance}{duration}. But it's possible that you weren't travelling at that speed for very much of the journey at all. If you made a movie clip of your cycle computer, showing your current speed, it's likely that for most frames it wouldn't be showing ValueUnit{7.5}{kilometre / hour}.}

StepHeader{Making intelligent choices}

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the learning}

Dividing the distance covered during the journey (kilometre) by the duration of the journey (hour) will give an average speed:FractionBdCeqA{distance}{duration}{WordSub{speed}{average}}

This global value can't be allowed to become confused with the values shown on the measuring instruments carried on the journey, which will show the values at a particular time, not over the whole duration of the journey.

Such right-now representations are true at an instant (so have no necessary connections to the history of the journey up to that instant). Here are some examples: resultant forces, velocities, accelerations, instantaneous speed, and positions.

ThinkHeader{Thinking about the teaching}

You'll need to think about how to refer to measurements that represent an average for a whole journey, or for a significant interval during that journey.

You'll also need to think how to refer to values that represent a right-now value, for a particular clock time, at that instant.

Here are some suggestions, for thoughtful adaptation to your own practice and situation.

Resultant forces, forces, velocities, accelerations and positions are right-now representations, and so are true at an instant (no history). The clock reading is always a series of instants.

So time is always WordSub{time}{instantaneous}. QuoteThis{QuantitySymbol{t}} stands for this, and only this. Some instant, defined by a clock reading. A unique now-ness. So:

VectorSub{v}{instantaneous} is a longer way of writing VectorOver{v}.

VectorSub{s}{instantaneous} is a longer way of writing VectorOver{s}.

VectorSub{a}{instantaneous} is a longer way of writing VectorOver{a}.

VectorSub{F}{instantaneous} is a longer way of writing VectorOver{F}.

If we want to deal with them as averages (we'd suggest avoiding this until post-16 studies, if possible) we'd extend the conventions SymbolEndash for example SymbolEndash like this:

VectorSub{v}{average}; VectorSub{s}{average}; VectorSub{a}{average}.
