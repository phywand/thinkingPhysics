The following question, relating to the effect of increasing the number of cells in a circuit, was set to a group of students after their 11&ndash;14 teaching about electric circuits.

The bulb in circuit A is glowing normally.

How is the bulb in circuit B glowing?

CharList
- It's dim.
- It's glowing normally.
- It's glowing brightly.
- It's off.
EndList

Explain your answer.

Correct answer:

The bulb is bright.

Explanation:

With two cells there is a larger current everywhere in the circuit and a bigger potential difference is created across the bulb. The power output of the bulb (which depends on the potential difference and on the current) is therefore larger.

StepHeader{Students' answers and implications}

Student 1:

c. Bright.

QuoteThis{This is because instead of getting ValueUnit{100}{&percnt;} energy it is getting ValueUnit{200}{&percnt;} to make light up double more than normal.}

Student 2:

c. Bright.

QuoteThis{Because there is more energy and it only has to power one bulb so the bulb will be brighter than with one battery.}

Student 3:

c. Bright.

QuoteThis{There is more charges getting to it because there are charges coming out of each battery.}

Student 4:

c. Bright.

QuoteThis{The more batteries the more charges the more energy but more bulbs it would be dim or off.}

Student 5:

c. Bright.

QuoteThis{Because there are two batteries there is double the amount of energy flowing to the bulb.}

Student answers SymbolEndash right lines or wrong track? All of the students make a correct prediction of bulb brightness.

Students 1, 2 and 5 all refer to there being more energy for the bulb. Students 3 and 4 suggest that there are QuoteThis{more charges getting to it}. This is correct in the sense that with two cells the charge moves round the circuit at a greater rate. It is clear, however, that student 3 is thinking in terms of the extra cell supplying QuoteThis{more charges}. This is not correct, unfortunately.
