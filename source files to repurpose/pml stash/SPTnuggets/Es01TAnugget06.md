This is rather a convergent activity. Children working in small groups around a computer screen, or collectively on a large shared display, can make up the map by choosing the statements in the drop-down menus. The display can be checked, then printed to provide a summary of their understanding.

A more divergent activity can be enjoyed by using paper SymbolEndash cutting the pieces out and arranging them on paper, before writing in the links. Alternatively, a number of concept mapping pieces of software are available, and you can prepare your own files as starters, adjusting these to suit your classes. The key is to think of what pieces of thinking you want them to do. These correspond precisely to the links you leave out on the concept map.
