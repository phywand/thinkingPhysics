StepHeader{Equations need to make sense}

Equations, such as FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}, are very important tools in physics. They summarise relationships in a precise and economical way and allow us to carry out simple calculations. One problem for many students in school is that they learn how to substitute values into an equation but have little sense of the QuoteThis{story} of the equation SymbolEndash what the equation is actually telling us.

To get round this learning challenge, whenever you're using an equation, ask the students to talk through how the equation connects the variables:

TeacherSpeak{We choose the potential difference and the resistance, and that fixes the current. Can anyone remember how these three are connected?}

TeacherSpeak{Good SymbolEndash now what happens to the current if the potential difference drops? And if the resistance grows very large&hellip; or very small?}

TeacherTip{Talk the calculation through, don't just write it down. FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{I}}{QuantitySymbol{V}}{QuantitySymbol{R}}, so the current is FractionBlock{xx volt}{yy ohm}, which works out as  zz ampere to 2 significant figures.}
