One of the great achievements of WordSuper{19}{th}  century physics is attributed to James Clerk Maxwell, who explained the link between electricity and magnetism. He showed that electric charge, once moving, creates a magnetic field. The physics of an electric motor makes use of this electromagnetic effect. Radio waves can be thought of as travelling magnetic and electric fields. It has been said that magnetism is just electricity on the move. This is an oversimplification, but Maxwell did pave the way for a unification in our understanding of magnetic and electric forces.
