WebTitle{Selecting and developing activities(Suggestions)}

TeacherTip{Based on the Physics Narrative and the Teaching and Learning Issues}

ThinkHeader{Ideas to emphasise here}

ListInformation
- choosing a point of view
- focusing on increasing separation between the point of view and the object whose speed your measuring
- show that finding a speed is not simple and straightforward
- explicitly identifying the distance covered, and the length of time taken in order to figure out a speed
- distinguish between spinning on an axis and orbiting another object
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Strategies for supporting learning}

ListInformation
- introduced the idea that relative motion is the only motion, without causing indigestion
- differentiate the ways in which QuoteThis{time} is used
- telling stories about journeys, relating what&apos;s observed to the record that is made
- taking care about the use of arrows SymbolEndash for representing force, direction, and velocity or speed
- sequencing the ideas carefully, drawing together the threads about force with the thread about changes in movement
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children&apos;s ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- defining speed without relating it to increasing separation
- getting bogged down in units SymbolEndash e.g. mph, kilometres per hour, furlongs per fortnight
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
