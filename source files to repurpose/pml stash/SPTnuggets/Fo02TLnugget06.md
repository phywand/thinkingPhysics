WebTitle{Thinking about actions to take(Suggestions)}

StepHeader{There's a good chance you could improve your teaching if you were to:}

ThinkHeader{Try these}

ListInformation
- Building explicit connections between the actions of animate and inanimate environments on an object
- Building in explicitly the steps from physical situation to the forces acting on the object
- Modelling how you come to expect a warp force to be acting
- Discussing the placement of arrows
- Focusing on the physical reasons for expecting a force to be acting SymbolEndash e.g. the bombardment by particles
- Sharing tangible examples of frictional forces
- Arranging for children to experience drag forces in air
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- Using friction as a blanket term, without reference to its physical origins
- Treating contact forces exerted by inanimate objects as obvious
- Stating, without sharing the appropriate experiences that give the statements meaning
- Being drawn into discussing the details of the drag forces
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
