StepHeader{Purpose}

This is a simple exploration of the reduction of the magnetic force with distance.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a bar magnet
- a paper clip
- several sheets of paper or card
ListEquipmentEnd


StepHeader{Happens}

Ask the children to use a magnet to pick up a paper clip.  Then see how many pieces of paper or card can be inserted between the clip and the magnet before it no longer picks it up. You&apos;ll need to try this out beforehand with your magnets to see if paper or card is better.

This is an opportunity to develop investigative skills: designing, recording, and reporting.

As an extension ask the students to compare and contrast:

TeacherSpeak{Magnetism seems to work through the paper.  How is this similar to gravity?  How is it different to gravity?}
