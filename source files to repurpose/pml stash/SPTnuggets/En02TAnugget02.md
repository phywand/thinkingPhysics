We provide an image, but you can use any single image that you want, so that you can explore the process of QuoteThis{choosing what to study} in your own context.

StepHeader{Happens}

Launch the first interactive object, then discuss the placement of the box that decides what you'll study and describe. What are you going to include and exclude? Why are you including or excluding those pieces?

If you want to use your own photograph, first export the interactive object, then replace the image file (image.jpg) with your own image. Your own image must be named image.jpg.

Launch the second interactive object, then choose where to place the box, so defining the change carefully. Discuss where you will start and where you will end the change as you run through the photograph sequence. What are you going to include and exclude? Why are you including or excluding these processes?

If you want to use your own photographs, first export the interactive object, then replace the image files with your own. Your own must be named image1.jpg, image2.jpg, image3.jpg, image4.jpg and image5.jpg. You'll find it helpful if the images record exactly the same piece of space but at different times.
