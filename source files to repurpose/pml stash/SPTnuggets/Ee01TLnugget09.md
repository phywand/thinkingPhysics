WebTitle{Loops and circuits(Teaching tip)}

StepHeader{Use two terms interchangeably}

You might try using the term QuoteThis{loop} interchangeably with QuoteThis{circuit}.

Thus:

TeacherSpeak{Connect the components into a complete loop.}

in addition to

TeacherSpeak{Connect the components into a complete circuit.}

This helps to emphasise the simple, closed geometry of electric circuits. It also fits nicely with talking about the QuoteThis{rope loop model} for the electric circuit.

You might even explicitly move between discussing the QuoteThis{mechanical loop} (the rope loop) and the QuoteThis{electrical loop} (the circuit on the benchtop).

TeacherTip{Consider renaming at least part of the entire topic QuotationThis{electrical loops} rather than QuotationThis{electric circuits}.}
