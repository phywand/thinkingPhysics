Except for individual study for the particularly interested, we do not suggest that you ask pupils to research how a rainbow comes about, nor that you explain it in class. The process is not simple, involving reflection and refraction within the raindrop and the contribution of lots of separate raindrops. By all means enjoy a striking image, but do not explain it to death. Pupils of this age are not likely to enjoy following the necessary detail for so little reward.
