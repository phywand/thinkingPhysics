WebTitle{Selecting and developing activities(Suggestions)}

TeacherTip{Based on the Physics Narrative and the Teaching and Learning Issues}

ThinkHeader{Ideas to emphasise here}

ListInformation
- the complete loop, working all together
- something moving round, everywhere in the loop
- build on the idea that something is used up as the battery flattens
- relate your model of something moving around the loop to actions in adding elements to a loop
- connect toolkits for thinking with physical experiences with circuits
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{Work through the Physics Narrative to find these lines of thinking worked out and then look in the Teaching Approaches for some examples of activities.}

ThinkHeader{Strategies for supporting learning}

ListInformation
- draw out, and challenge QuoteThis{wrong track} thinking
- link practical experiences to developing descriptions
- let children use pictures, diagrams, physical actions and physical models as well as words to express themselves
- develop a toolkit to support children&apos;s reasoning about circuits
- allow children to question and explore different explanations
- retain a focus on whole loops
- link practical experiences to developing descriptions
- relate children&apos;s pictures, diagrams, physical actions and physical models to what happens when real circuits are built
- encourage children to reason about circuits, making and testing predictions
- use large drawings of circuits to help relate the physical to the drawings
ListInformationEnd

TeacherTip{These are all related to findings about children&apos;s ideas from research. The teaching activities will provide some suggestions. So will colleagues, near and far.}

ThinkHeader{Avoid these}

ListInformation
- not challenging imprecise language, reasoning, diagramming
- using sequential models, such as donation models
- QuoteThis{electrical energy}
- telling long stories about electrons in wires as QuoteThis{just how it is}
- avoid sequential reasoning: QuoteThis{first it leaves the battery, then it...}
- just stating what QuoteThis{should have happened}
- relating ad-hoc rules as QuoteThis{just how it is}
- not conflating homely analogies with ways of reasoning that can make predictions

TeacherTip{These difficulties are distilled from: the research findings; the practice of well-connected teachers with expertise; issues intrinsic to representing the physics well.}
