WebTitle{Introducing resistance(teacher exposition)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Introduce the idea of resistance as the equivalent of the grab on the rope. As you do so, insert what are more resistive elements (choose longer, thinner chunks of material) into an electrical loop. There should also be some visible effect on the amount of glowing or other effects. A pair of children can act as a useful prop, modelling the rope loop. Discussions could help translate your actions from the electrical back into the rope model.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Lead students to connect the reduced glowing of a bulb to extra material inserted into a loop. You are reducing the glowing of a bulb by increasing the resistance of the circuit. The push or pull stays the same, and there is a reduced flow, so increase the grab on a rope in the rope loop model.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- 3 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, identical colour
- pair of ValueUnit{50}{mm} square plates, with centrally mounted ValueUnit{4}{mm} sockets (or crocodile clips and a pair of ValueUnit{50}{mm} square plates as an alternative)
- conductive putty
- conductive fluid

StepHeader{Happens}

Start with a simple series circuit, with the two plates touching. The bulb will be glowing brightly.  Relate this to the rope loop model. Then open up the gap between the plates and insert increasing widths of putty and later fluid into the gap. The bulb will glow less brightly.

TeacherSpeak{what do you notice about the brightness of the bulb as I put more stuff into the circuit?}

TeacherSpeak{How can we act out this change using a rope loop?}

Link the electrical changes to the changes made in the rope loop, identifying grab with resistance. Point out that each of the different things put into a circuit all have a particular resistance.

Summarise:
TeacherSpeak{The resistance is a property of a thing. The material and its dimensions set the resistance.  Model this property of the component by the grab on the rope. SpacingParabreak EqualityAssertion{QuoteThis{grab}}{QuoteThis{resistance}}}
