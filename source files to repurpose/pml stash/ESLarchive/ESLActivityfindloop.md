WebTitle{Whereâ€™s the loop?(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Draw on prior experiences (both curricular and not) to establish that loops are everywhere in electrical technology. Images and circuits on the bench-top and appliances all serve to stimulate discussion. At this stage, it's useful to concentrate on circuits where power transmission is more important than transmitting information.

StepHeader{Purpose}

To focus the attention on electrical loops all around us.
