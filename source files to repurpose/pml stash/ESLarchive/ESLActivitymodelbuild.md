WebTitle{Build and model two circuits(small group practical)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Children build two electrical loops and notice what's happening in each. Then model each with a rope loop, taking it in turns to act out the parts and to describe what's happening. Some groups could then predict changes in the model loop related to changes they've made in the rope loop. Still with only two things in the loop at this stage.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Moving from drawn circuits to circuits built on the bench-top is a good way to explore how students interpret the diagrams, as well as practising their interpretations. But the main purpose here is to start to think with the rope loop model, encouraging active exploration and supporting the students in expresing theier ideas.

StepHeader{Prepare}

For each group, access to a power supply, a rope loop, leads, and at least a pair of bulbs.

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- 2 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, identical colour
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- a power resistor, ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{2}{W}
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)
- some printed diagrams of circuits to build

StepHeader{Happens}

This activity may be the first time students have built several circuits, so emphasise the need to make the connections with care. For some classes having large printouts of the circuits lying on the bench, that they can quite literally build on top of may help reduce the tangle.

Promote discussion about connections between the rope loop model and the built electric circuits. Maintin a particular focus on how to adjust the grab and pull on the rope loop to represent the changes they make in the circuits, as components are changed.

Expect this relationship, even if expressed informally, to feature in the discussions.

FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}

Challenge the groups to provide an agreed account of how a change in the circuit as they move from one example to the next can be acted-out with the rope loop.

The  number of circuits built and the selection of such circuits will depend on the quantities of apparatus, the speed of any one group, and the rigour and diligence of the group. But any one group will need to build at least two circuits, and you should encourage every group to  compare the circuits they build.

What's important is the reasoning about the circuit.

TeacherTip{Watch out for groups that rush through the building, but do not discuss how they can account for the changes they notice.}

Summarise the activity by comparing the actions on the rope loop with the changes made in changing from one circuit to another. You might draw a pair of trend arrows over the grid, labelled QuoteThis{more pull} and QuoteThis{more grab}.
