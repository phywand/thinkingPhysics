WebTitle{Introducing the rope loop(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

This is an interactive teacher-led discussion using a rope loop to make predictions about electrical loops. SpacingParabreak First, draw out the active parts of the electrical loops. Then relate what's running down in the electrical loop to the action of the battery hand, and connect what's warming (or other useful tasks, glowing, moving etc.) to the grabbing action of the resistor hand. SpacingParabreak Vary the pull of one hand and how hard the other hand grabs and draw out predictions for an electrical loop. SpacingLinebreak The action of the battery is often described as a push, rather than a pull, but you'll have trouble pushing a rope. SpacingParabreak There is nothing hard here, but there is a potential tripwire to be aware of, which can be stepped over (if noticed by the class) by reminding the students that the idea of force comes from the idea of their agency of pushing or pulling.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Present the rope loop as a way of helping students understand the intangibles in electric circuits (such as charge, current, resistance, voltage) by relating them directly to the movement of a length of rope around in a loop. Don't define these intangibles in this activity SymbolEmdash that comes better later when the students are familiar with the ideas.

Notice how the same things are happening in the rope loop as in the electric circuit: a chemical store is emptying(teacher as a battery), and at a distance, something is warming(student as a bulb).

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- 3-4 m rope (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)
- a simple circuit on the bench: ValueUnit{12}{V} bulb, 2 wires, power supply

StepHeader{Happens}

To introduce the rope loop, keep things very simple SymbolEmdash the equivalent of one battery(the teacher) and one bulb(a student). The teacher starts to move the loop of rope round by pulling, hand over hand.
The student varies their grabbing of the rope, which changes the flow of the rope.

The informal schema to exploit is

FractionABC{flow}{push}{resistance}

which, for a rope loop is

FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}

And this maps onto to the electric circuit as

FractionABC{current}{voltage}{resistance}

Run a discussion which brings out the relationships for the rope, and enlivens the connections to the electric circuit.

Establish essential features:

ListInformation
- the teacher pulling on the rope represents the battery.
- the pupil grabbing the rope resists the movement of the rope, and this represents the bulb
- the moving rope represents the electric current
- the hand warms and glows because of the working (due to friction) at the QuoteThis{bulb hand}.

StepHeader{Linking the rope loop to correct thinking about electric circuits}

You can start to lead students to helpful ways of thinking about the electrical circuit.

What flows starts in the circuit, not in the battery.

TeacherSpeak{Now it's clear. The rope isn't coming from me. I'm just making it move around. In just the same way, the battery is not the source of whatever it is that moves around in the circuit. The battery gets things moving.}

What flows in the circuit is set into motion all at the same time.

TeacherSpeak{Look, everybody! As soon as I set the rope moving here, it starts moving all around the loop. It's just like a circuit; you get movement in all parts of the circuit as soon as there is a complete loop.}

Current is the same in each part of the loop.

TeacherSpeak{Just as much rope returns to me as leaves me every second. The rope does not get used up or disappear on the way round. In just the same way, nothing electrical gets used up on the way around the circuit, so the current is the same everywhere.}

You get glowing or warming where there is resistance.

TeacherSpeak{Now Julia can feel her hands warming up because she is grabbing the rope. There is warming as the rope slides through her fingers. No-where else is warming because there is no resisting of the movement of the rope anywhere else.}

We'd suggest that you link this to the EmphasiseThis{big} circuit!

It just doesn't matter how EmphasiseThis{big} the circuit is SymbolEmdash unless it crosses the Atlantic!
