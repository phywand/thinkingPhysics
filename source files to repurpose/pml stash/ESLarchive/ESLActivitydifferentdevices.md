WebTitle{Different devices(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Show different devices doing different jobs to flatten the battery. Compare each one to the simple circuit containing a glowing lamp, and model each with a rope loop.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Show a common pattern across different devices, doing useful-working in different ways as the battery is running-down.

StepHeader{Prepare}

Curate a collection of battery-powered devices. For clarity, avoid anything driven by a power-pack or from the mains.

ListEquipment
- a battery-powered fan
- a battery torch 
- a battery-powered model vehicle, driven along by an electric motor
- a battery-powered motor lifting a load 
- ValueRange{3}{4}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)

StepHeader{Happens}

For each device, discuss its job. Use everyday experiences to sort them into one of three QuoteThis{bins}: those devices which lead to running-down fast, running-down slowly; and somewhere in-between. Model each set by the rope loop, working out what to change about the rope loop.

You might choose to accumulate a set all of which use the same battery, or at least to use such a subset first.

Then, either avoid complications over varying voltage and battery capacity altogether by selection of examples, or inject them here as additional refinements.
