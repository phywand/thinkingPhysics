StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Reflect on the importance of measureing and calculating, giving students reason to practice both.

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

PiperLink{Few students can say in words what the physical quantity measured by a voltmeter is. SpacingLinebreak  Students may struggle to explain what the physical quantity being measured in volts is. This is particularly so when the voltmeter is connected across passive components, rather than across the power source.}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-can-say-words-what-physical-quantity-measured-voltmeter}

PiperLink{Few students use the Voltage-Resistance-Current (VRI) model of a series circuit. SpacingLinebreak Few students use a model of a series circuit as a system in which an agent (whose strength is measured in volts) causes an electric current around the circuit, the size of which is also determined by the resistance of the circuit (the VRI model).}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-use-voltage-resistance-current-vri-model-series-circuit}

PiperLink{Many students are unable to connect an ammeter in a circuit correctly. SpacingLinebreak  Many students are not confident using an ammeter to measure the electric current at a named point in a circuit diagram. This can be particularly challenging for students if the desired point in the diagram does not correspond to a specific wire in the real circuit.}{https://spark.iop.org/many-pupils-are-unable-connect-ammeter-circuit-correctly}

StepHeader{Teacher's thinking}

{>>STARTTEACHERBLOCK<<}
Now that there is an excellent physical basis, it's time to formalise the measurable physical quantities. Relating these quantities to the rope loop connects to the tangible and can help to support productive reasoning. Keep emphasising the physical, resisting the temptation to rely on mathematical abstractions and algorithms.

This idea is quite standard ground, but the approach is from a slightly different angle, so do work in the light of the resources made available.

In particular, the ammeter measures some kind of flow, and now might be the time to point out, with a light touch, that physics does know that electrons are what drift along in metallic wires. This drift is a gentle amble superimposed on top of the frantic rushing about of the thermal motion of the electrons: take acre with depictions which suggest otherwise.

Similarly, the voltmeter measures some kind of push, but again how the push is happening is not central to reasoning about circuits, so any account still needs to make this clear.

What remains a secure guide to reasoning and the supporting representations are the connections between the rope loop and the electrical loop. Now is the time to exploit those, drawing on the formal mapping between the two kinds of loops. There is probably enough ability to think physically about the electrical circuits that the introduction of the mathematical relationships will not displace that competence.


Resistance, first introduced as a given property of an object, can be defined, operationalising that quantity.  

Power, the generalised measure of warming or glowing that's been there since the beginning, can be defined, again operationalising that quantity.

Here is an excellent opportunity to draw attention to a way in which physics makes progress through careful measurement, so setting the focus for the practical activities.

StepHeader{Students' thinking}

The connections between rope loop and electrical loop support an understanding of what the ammeter and voltmeter are measuring.

Combining the measurements is also supported by the same connections. students are moving from the informal schema, such as

FractionABC{flow}{push}{resistance}

Interpreting this through the rope loop relationships:

FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}

And moving to formal statements of physics:

FractionABC{current}{voltage}{resistance}

Skilful measurement requires careful intervention in the world.
