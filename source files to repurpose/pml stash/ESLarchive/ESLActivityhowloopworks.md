WebTitle{How the loop works(small group discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Use a discussion starter to run a small group discussion exploring students' ideas about how electrical loops work. Use the intelligence gathered to challenge the unhelpful ideas and build on the useful ideas in the remainder of the sequence.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Run an exploratory discussion to find out how students think electric circuits work.

StepHeader{Happens}

Ask the groups to decide how they think the loop works, drawing on what they've studied before and what they've come across in their homes.

Establish the usual respectful discussion parameters, of listening and considering before responding. Encourage the sharing of reasons.

You might ask for two or three sentences from each group. Suggest or require a certainty score for each sentence, reflecting their collective confidence that the sentence is a reliable way of thinking about circuits. A simple pie chart, scoring 0-4, can provide a scannable visual reference if you decide to keep these views on the classroom wall to refer to later.
