WebTitle{Trade-offs in ways of warming with a rope(small group practical)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Working with rope loops, challenging groups to find different ways of doing more warming of the QuoteThis{bulb hand}, and different ways to achieve the same warming.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Practice using the informal schema:

ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}

to meet a series of challenges.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- ValueRange{3}{4}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

Set a series of challenges to meet:

1. Model a gently glowing bulb.
2. Change the QuoteThis{battery} to make the QuoteThis{bulb} brighter.
3. Change the flow to make the QuoteThis{bulb} brighter still, without changing the QuoteThis{battery}.
4. Change the flow to make the QuoteThis{bulb} much dimmer without changing the QuoteThis{battery}.

In each case, expect the students make a single change from the previous challenge.

Vary the challenges to suit the progress of the groups within the class.
