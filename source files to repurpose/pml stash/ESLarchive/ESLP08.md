WebTitle{Mains loops and safety: 8/8}

StepHeader{Lesson objectives}

- 

StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Extend thinking about circuist with rope loops to mains circuits, using what is known about circuits with parallel connections to explain designing for safety.

InsertGraphic{ESLAlternatingCurrentPID}{600}{600}

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

StepHeader{Ideas students have}

PiperLink{Few students can clearly distinguish the ideas of electric current and potential difference. SpacingLinebreak  Many students see potential difference, or voltage, as a consequence of electric current, rather than a cause of it.}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-can-clearly-distinguish-ideas-electric-current-and-potential-difference}

PiperLink{Few students are able to use the idea of potential to explain or predict observations about simple circuits. SpacingLinebreak  In particular, students often struggle to move beyond the idea of voltage being a measure of QuoteThis{strength of push} to the idea of it being a difference in some sort of QuoteThis{level}.}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-are-able-use-idea-potential-explain-or-predict-observations-about-simple-circuits}

PiperLink{Few students use the Voltage-Resistance-Current (VRI) model of a series circuit. SpacingLinebreak Few students use a model of a series circuit as a system in which an agent (whose strength is measured in volts) causes an electric current around the circuit, the size of which is also determined by the resistance of the circuit (the VRI model).}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-use-voltage-resistance-current-vri-model-series-circuit}

{>>STARTTEACHERBLOCK<<}

The simple rope loop produces the same warming by an alternating movement in place of the uni-directional movement previously. Apply the same relationships between flow, pull and grab. So, plan to reuse many competences in representing and reasoning.

InsertGraphic{ESLAlternatinCurrentPID}{550}{600}

Physics is simple because a few ideas can be reused in new contexts to generate new understanding.

Why most mains circuits are alternating current is best left for another time, to motivate work on electromagnetic induction, an aside here is probably enough.

Reasoning about parallel circuits provides a way into a design for safety, as its all about comparing currents in two loops and ensuring that there are only tiny currents in any loop containing a human. Effect this by cutting the current in the supply, whether by a fuse melting, or a circuit breaker relying on a more complicated mechanism. The focus is on how reasoning about loops enables a productive understanding of the design principles, rather than the physical details of wiring a plug, or similar.

Mains appliances provide a fruitful context for revisiting controlling glowing and warming and any other power-switching jobs. In addition to the handy feature of being able to break one loop without breaking another.

Rope loops can model alternating current as well as what I've done already. I can reuse all the ways of thinking I have learned. I can use my thinking about parallel loops to explain how my home is kept electrically safe.
