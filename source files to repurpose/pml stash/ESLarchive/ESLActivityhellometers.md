WebTitle{Hello meters(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Show how to measure current and voltage with meters. Relate this to what's happening in the rope loop. You can introduce a more sophisticated description of the measured quantities here, if liked, without making it central to how students reason with loops.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Introduce the ammeter and voltmeter and give an intelligible account of what they measure. Show how to connect the meters to components in circuits.

StepHeader{Prepare}

Two loops of rope, of different colours (matching the two colours of the pairs of wires) and lengths, but of identical diameter and construction.

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- a display ammeter, ValueRange{0}{5}{A}
- a display voltmeter, ValueRange{0}{20}{V}
- 6 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, including 2 pairs of identical colour
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- - ValueRange{4}{5}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}

Build a simple circuit, then show how to connect in the ammeter.

TeacherSpeak{Current in the <component>, so we insert the ammeter into to loop, just here&hellip;}

TeacherSpeak{Voltage across the <component>, so we insert the voltmeter across, just here&hellip;}

Repeat for circuits with series connections and then for circuits with parallel connections. Build the circuit first and then insert a single meter, talking it through as you go.

Avoid the temptation to QuoteThis{validate} any empirical rules: the students already have the rope loop to guide their thinking and so have no need of empirical rules.

Draw out the connections between the rope loops and the electrical loops: 

FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}  SymbolArrowright  FractionABC{current}{voltage}{resistance}

ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}  SymbolArrowright  ProductABC{power}{current}{voltage}

and relate these to the measurements that you are making.
