StepHeader{Lesson objectives}

StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Make predictions about electrical circuits with parallel connections on the basis of combining two separate rope loops.

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

PiperLink{Many students do not recognise that the potential difference across each resistor in a simple parallel circuit is the potential difference across the battery.

PiperLink{Many students predict incorrectly that two resistors in parallel will have a larger resistance than each resistor alone.

StepHeader{Teacher's thinking}

{>>STARTTEACHERBLOCK<<}
Starting with two separate loops, each of which is by now well-understood, and combining them to give a circuit with parallel connections provides a simple path to connecting this new configuration with existing knowledge.

InsertGraphic{ESLAddLoopParallelPID}{900}{362}

In loop one:

FractionABC{WordSub{flow}{one}}{WordSub{pull}{one}}{WordSub{grab}{one}}

ProductABC{WordSub{warming}{one}}{WordSub{flow}{one}}{WordSub{pull}{one}}

In loop two:

FractionABC{WordSub{flow}{two}}{WordSub{pull}{two}}{WordSub{grab}{two}}

ProductABC{WordSub{warming}{two}}{WordSub{flow}{two}}{WordSub{pull}{two}}


Combine the loops and the battery supplies the current for both, so you get a circuit with parallel connections. Resist the temptation to have a combined schema in front of mind!

InsertGraphic{ESLParallelRopePredictsElectricalPowerPID}{830}{580}

Emphasising the independence of the relationships between the flows in the two loops, and the addition of the flows when the loops are combined lays a foundation for expecting that breaking one loop will not affect the other. And a foundation for expecting that the battery will be running-down at a higher rate: no QuoteThis{something for nothing} again.

In each loop, the relationship between power, current and voltage remains identical.

StepHeader{Students' thinking}

{>>STARTstudentsBLOCK<<}
Students continue to reason informally about the relationships between flow, pull and grab, using diagrams and actions to support a schema like:

FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}.

Students apply this to two loops and then bring the loops together, by using identical pulls for both loops. In this way, one battery can be imagined to drive current in both loops.

Students relate the typical behaviour of circuits with parallel connections to the functioning of appliances in the house, where turning one bulb off does not usually turn off another. They also relate the different brightnesses of bulbs to the choice of the bulb, re-using the idea of trade-off and relating this to glowing. Now using a schema like:

ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}
