WebTitle{Design tasks(small group practical)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Set a series of challenges where the solutions are simple circuits. Encourage thinking in terms of loops to solve the problems. Expect a  written record of the (tested) solutions. Testing means demonstrating the suitability of a suggestion by building a working circuit.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Consolidate thinking about loops, including pairs of loops, with a focus on 

StepHeader{Prepare}

Per group:

ListEquipment
- a battery
- 2 low voltage bulbs, mounted 
- 6 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, 3 pairs of identical colour
-  2 SPST switches
-  2 SPDT switches
- printed set of challenges
- A3 or larger paper to record solutions and thinking.
- ValueUnit{2}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- ValueUnit{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}

Guide each group through an appropriate sequence of challenges. Require the groups to record their solutions and reasoning as intelligible display documents.
