WebTitle{Predictions about glowing(small group practical)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

students build circuits with bulbs of different brightnesses, using the rope loop to model these circuits. Use a simple, informal system of units for the voltage of power supplies and the resistance of bulbs to set a ranking challenge based on the rope loop model.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Use a rope loop model to account for the brightness of different lamps.

Vary both the lamp and the battery.

StepHeader{Prepare}

For each group:

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- 2 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, identical colour
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)
- some printed diagrams of circuits to build
ListEquipmentEnd

StepHeader{Happens}

students build the circuit and then use the rope loop to account for the brightness of the bulbs. Compare different ways of making the grabbing hand warm (by high flow, or high pull). Relate this to the different ways in which the bulb can be made to glow equally brightly, connected to the idea of a trade-off.
