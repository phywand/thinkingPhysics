StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Support students in reasoning about circuits with series connections, working from the rope loop to the electrical loop.

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

PiperLink{Many students are unable to make correction predictions about the potential difference across each resistor in a series circuit given the battery's potential difference and the resistance of the resistors. SpacingLinebreak Many students try using shortcuts or QuoteThis{rukles of thumb} to reason about circuits with series connections, and sequential reasoning rather than systematic reasoning is also a barrier. }{https://spark.iop.org/many-pupils-are-unable-make-correction-predictions-about-potential-difference-across-each-resistor}

PiperLink{Few students use the Voltage-Resistance-Current (VRI) model of a series circuit. SpacingLinebreak Few students use a model of a series circuit as a system in which an agent (whose strength is measured in volts) causes an electric current around the circuit, the size of which is also determined by the resistance of the circuit (the VRI model).}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-use-voltage-resistance-current-vri-model-series-circuit}

Circuits with multiple series connections seem more complicated to reason about than those just made of multiple simple loops. That's why this sequence moves from simple loops to circuits with parallel connections built of simple loops before adding a component into the simple loop, resulting in circuits with series connections. The research-documented, persistent, and mistaken approaches to reasoning about circuits may go some way towards accounting for this difficulty.

The idea that things (QuoteThis{charge}, QuoteThis{energy}) start from the battery and interact with the components in sequence wreaks particular damage. Avoid this tripwire by continuing to emphasise thinking about each loop as a single connected system.

In a circuit with series connections, the resistance sets the voltage across each resistive component. Therefore the warming or glowing for each component may be different, even if the current in the components is identical. Make links to the first way in which power could be controlled in a loop (in parallel loops you could alter the resistance of the component in each loop). You'll also need to make the differences understandable. You can use the physical experiences of working with the rope loop to maintain this distinction.

It's possible to develop competence and some fluency in working through the interplay of these ideas can while building and modelling circuits – QuoteThis{hands-on} and QuoteThis{minds-on} physics.

The physical experiences with a rope loop guide reasoning about circuits with three components. Now there are three hands in play. One hand is pulling, representing the battery, and two hands are grabbing, one for each resistive element. To maintain a flow with more grabbing – it doesn't matter by which hand – the battery has to pull more. So the battery runs-down faster. And the QuoteThis{resisting hand} that's grabbing most is warming most. The order of the hands in the loop does not matter.

Every step in the prediction of how much any bulb is glowing is kept separate.
1. Find the flow in the loop
2. Find the grab for the bulb you're interested in
3. Work out the warming for the bulb
As a result, reasoning supports physics.
