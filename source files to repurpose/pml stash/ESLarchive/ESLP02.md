WebTitle{Modelling a loop: 2/8}

This lesson is the core of this sequence, so it's best to avoid the temptation to rush. Electric circuits earn their place in physics teaching because they are the prototype example of reasoning with systems.

StepHeader{Lesson objectives}

- Get students thinking about systems (a set of things working together as a whole)

- Introduce students to complete loops as the way of reasoning about circuits

- Begin to develop a model of an electrical circuit: a rope loop. Encourage students to reason about the whole loop, rather than the individual components in the loop to avoid reinforcing misconceptions that arise from this approach.

Towards the end of the lesson, students should have confidence in making predictions about electrical loops based on experiences with and reasoning about rope loops.

StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

You are providing students with tools to think with by reasoning with a rope loop.

InsertGraphic{ESLReimagineElectricalRopePID}{432}{270}

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

StepHeader{Ideas students have}

PiperLink{Some younger students hold a 'consumer-source' model of the simple circuit. SpacingLinebreak  These students may think that the battery (the 'source') gives something to the bulb (the 'consumer'). They may think, therefore, that a single wire from a battery terminal to a bulb terminal will be sufficient to light the bulb.}{https://spark.iop.org/some-younger-pupils-hold-consumer-source-model-simple-circuit}

PiperLink{Many students see circuit behaviour as a sequence of causes and effects, rather than seeing the whole circuit as an interacting system. SpacingLinebreak Students will often offer explanations of their predictions about what will happen when a circuit is changed in some way that is based on sequential reasoning, rather than seeing the whole circuit as an interacting system.}{https://spark.iop.org/many-pupils-see-circuit-behaviour-sequence-causes-and-effects-rather-seeing-whole-circuit}

PiperLink{Most students see the battery as the source of electrical effects in a circuit. SpacingLinebreak The battery is only one component amongst many. Thinking of it in isolation may support imagining the battery as having properties that are independent of the loop that you wire it into.}{https://spark.iop.org/most-pupils-see-battery-source-electrical-effects-circuit}

EEFPreconceptionsLink{The suggested sequence of activities in the lesson plan that follows helps to address these preconceptions.}

You will want to tailor these activities to your own students' needs and the challenges facing them. Some of these activities may need adapting to your schools' resources and the lesson time available.

ActivitySynopsis{02}{Introducing the rope loop}{15}{teacher demonstration}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivityropeloop.html}{This is an interactive teacher-led discussion using a rope loop to make predictions about electrical loops. SpacingParabreak First, draw out the active parts of the electrical loops. Then relate what's running down in the electrical loop to the action of the battery hand, and connect what's warming (or other useful tasks, glowing, moving, etc.) to the grabbing action of the resistor hand. SpacingParabreak Vary the pull of one hand and how hard the other hand grabs and draw out predictions for an electrical loop. SpacingLinebreak The action of the battery is often described as a push, rather than a pull, but you'll have trouble pushing a rope. SpacingParabreak If the change from push to pull appears as a tripwire, remind students that the idea of force comes from the idea of their agency of pushing or pulling SymbolEmdash there is nothing hard here.}

EEFLanguageScienceLink{Grab is deliberately used in preference to grip since elsewhere in physics students may have come across grip forces. This decision is an example of a principled, deliberate choice of language to achieve clarity in teaching.}

EEFModellingLink{What happens inside the wires is both invisible and hard to imagine. So help students develop a model that they can use to predict all the behaviours of an electrical circuit. The rope loop model is best, both for simplicity and because students can manipulate it and feel the effects. It is tangible and helps develop the idea of continuous flow. Later, students' understanding of circuits might be developed further by comparing different models, but understanding is too fragile at this stage, and multiple models would add to the cognitive load.}


ActivitySynopsis{03}{Build and model two circuits}{25}{small group practical}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivitymodelbuild.html}{Children build two electrical loops and notice what's happening in each. Then model each with a rope loop, taking it in turns to act out the parts and to describe what's happening. Some groups could then predict changes in the model loop related to changes they've made in the rope loop. Still with only two things in the loop at this stage.}

ActivitySynopsis{04}{Introducing resistance}{10}{teacher exposition}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivityintroduceresistance.html}{Introduce the idea of resistance as the equivalent of the grab on the rope. As you do so, insert what are more resistive elements (choose longer, thinner chunks of material) into an electrical loop. There should also be some visible effect on the amount of glowing or other effects. A pair of children can act as a useful prop, modelling the rope loop. Discussions could help translate your actions from the electrical back into the rope model.}

EEFMemoryLink{Students may often be able to draw or enact an understanding which they cannot yet verbalise. You can exploit that here to help them retain this knowledge.}

Move among the four views of a circuit loop in developing the model, aiming for simplicity. Share your reasons for settling on an appropriately simple description, matched to what you want to do with it.

InsertGraphic{ESLFourViewsCircuitsLoopsLabelledPID}{860}{520}

A simple circuit has one battery and one resistive element, and that's all we deal with in this lesson. As an overview for you, with only two QuoteThis{hands} on the loop, one for the battery and one for the bulb or other resistive element.

Students build from recognising the existence of a simple loop as the necessary condition for a circuit QuoteThis{working} to a reliable and accessible way of reasoning about loops.

Towards the end of the lesson students should have confidence in making predictions about electrical loops based on experiences with and reasoning about rope loops.

The cognitive schema that applies to both loops is FractionABC{flow}{push}{resistance}. You should bring this out, although writing it down may not help all children.

Confidence is misplaced without competence, which comes from fluency. Practice, which the lesson should offer, builds fluency.
