StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Support students to make predictions about simple electrical loops based on physical experiences with rope loops.

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

StepHeader{Ideas students have}

PiperLink{Many students think that a battery supplies the same current, regardless of the circuit in which it is used. SpacingLinebreak Those students who do not use this idea in straightforward situations may revert to it in slightly more complex ones.}{https://spark.iop.org/many-pupils-think-battery-supplies-same-current-regardless-circuit-which-it-used}

PiperLink{Students often consider the behaviour of a circuit in terms of current and much less often in terms of potential difference. SpacingLinebreak Current and potential difference jointly determine the power switched in a circuit element, but often student reasoning focuses on changes in either one or the other.}{https://spark.iop.org/students-often-consider-behaviour-circuit-terms-current-and-much-less-often-terms-potential}

PiperLink{Few students use the Voltage-Resistance-Current (VRI) model of a series circuit. SpacingLinebreak Few students use a model of a series circuit as a system in which an agent (whose strength is measured in volts) causes an electric current around the circuit, the size of which is also determined by the resistance of the circuit (the VRI model).}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-use-voltage-resistance-current-vri-model-series-circuit}

StepHeader{Teacher's thinking}

{>>STARTTEACHERBLOCK<<}
Starting with the big circuit is a great choice to reiterate the systemic ideas of the loop from the last passage. That there is no delay between completing the loop and the light coming on can be worked into a persuasive case for the battery not being the source of the charge and the energy not being given to the charge as it leaves the battery. These are two well-established missteps in reasoning about circuits, so foreground them here as a resource for students to sharpen their ideas. 

Electrical devices switch power and easily control the switching of that power. As that's perhaps the reason why electrical loops are so prevalent, keep it a significant focus of sequence. Warming and glowing are two easily identifiable actions of electrical devices of many kinds, from things that warm our homes, water and food, to things that help us see during the hours of the night. You can talk about more or less warming or glowing in a semi-quantitative way without having to formalise the idea of power just yet SymbolEndash that comes later. So concentrate on simple circuits containing a bulb, or a (power) resistor that gets warm without glowing in the visible and a battery or power supply.

InsertGraphic{ESLSwitchComponentsInOutPID}{550}{450}

If you're going to use power supplies, provide some account of how these replace batteries, drawing on and linking to the identification of loops in the first passage.

The core new chunk of reasoning is the ability to use the rope loop model to predict how the glowing or warming depends on the choice of battery/power supply and the choice of resistor/lamp.
Link the glowing and warming to the running-down of the battery (or appropriate resource for the power supply).

Give students plenty of practice in working with the informal relationships, between the pull of the battery hand, the grab of the device hand, and the flow. Link this to their physical experiences.

Later introduce other devices such as motors, not designed to glow or warm, linking what they do to the running down.

In the front of your mind, as the focus for this lesson, is 
ProductABC{power}{current}{voltage}, and for a rope loop ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}.

StepHeader{Students' thinking}

{>>STARTstudentsBLOCK<<}

Students continue to reason with the loop as a whole, explicitly representing what are and are not good ways to think about what is going on, using diagrams, drawings, actions and words.

Students recognise that engineers design electrical devices to perform specific tasks when placed in a loop: focussing on warming and glowing. They make connections to illuminating and warming their homes and cooking their food, whether by conventional oven, toaster, grill or microwave. The detailed mechanism is not essential, but that there is a cost for the action is: something for nothing is not possible in the physical world. They link the running down of the drawdrawBattery(or substitute) to the desired glowing or warming.

Reason about trade-offs in getting the warming or glowing as choices between high flow and low pull, or high pull and low flow. They acquire confidence in their ability to reason informally, so semi-quantitatively, about the actions of the circuit.
