WebTitle{Circuit and model: series connections(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Introduce a circuit with two bulbs in series, showing how to model this with a rope loop. Make predictions, based on experiences with the rope loop, about the relative brightness of the bulbs.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Construct an account which predicts the relative brightness of bulbs in a series circuit.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- 3 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads of identical colour
- ValueRange{4}{5}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)

StepHeader{Happens}

Start by building and modelling a simple loop, containing first one bulb, then the other. Use the relationships FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab} and ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull} to show that the ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb has a higher resistance and is represented by a hand which grabs more.

Now, using the rope loop, put the two students' hands one after the other, but spaced around the loop. Label and draw attention to which hand represents which bulb, and ensure that the difference in grab matches that label. Start the rope moving and ask which hand is warming fastest. Focus on each hand and discuss the warming there. Either reverse the flow, or the positions of the twoQuoteThis{bulbs}, showing show that it is the grab and not the position that determines the warming.

Finally, build the circuit with series connections on the bench-top and notice how the predictions are related to the glowing.
