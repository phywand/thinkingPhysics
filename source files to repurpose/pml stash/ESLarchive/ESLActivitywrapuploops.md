WebTitle{Wrapping up the loops(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Summarises what students have learnt, connecting thinking with the rope loop to what happens on the lab bench.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Build electrical loops, and model them with rope loops. Summarise the sequence of lessons. 

StepHeader{Prepare}

Two loops of rope, of different colours matching the two colours of the pairs of wires) and lengths, but of the small diameter and construction.

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- 2 of  ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- 2 of ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- 4 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, 2 pairs of identical colour
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- ValueRange{4}{5}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}


Build and model a collection of circuits to explore and summarise what you've worked on during the sequence.

- a simple loop
- two loops and parallel connections
- series connections
- designing for safety with two loops
- how to measure and calculate electrical quantities

Emphasise the connections and relationships:

FractionABC{current}{voltage}{resistance}  SymbolArrowright  FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}  

ProductABC{power}{current}{voltage}  SymbolArrowright  ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}  

And mention the idea of a QuoteThis{trade-off} again.
