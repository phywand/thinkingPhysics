WebTitle{A teachable sequence for electric circuits}

There are eight passages of classroom teaching, each designed to fill an hour-long slot. The sequence is for early secondary children, who will have some preliminary curricular experiences with circuits, and slightly more extensive experiences of putting electric circuits to work in their everyday lived-in world.

StepHeader{Sequence Structure}

For each of the eight passages of teaching in the sequence, there are four interwoven strands.
- Some QuoteThis{teacher's thinking}, to guide the interventions and establish the line of thinking
- Some QuoteThis{children's reasoning}, illustrating how children come to represent and reason about circuits during the passage
- A suggested sequence of activities, as a skeleton animated by the teacher thinking and children reasoning strands.

StepHeader{Profiling each activity}

Every activity has a profile, detailing particular opportunities and emphases. Different kinds of activities lend themselves to working on the minds of others in specific ways, as do the ideas already available to think with. The duration of each activity further constrains reasonable expectations. The sequence and the profile provide a practical guide for preparation, planning, and adaptions during implementation. (What am I doing now? What am I hoping the children will be thinking? So a pragmatic heuristic ).

StepHeader{Teacher practices, supporting learning in physics}

exemplifying thinking in physics
  - offering behaviour for imitation  
  - guiding participation in reasoning

elucidating children's thinking
  - drawing out what's thought
  - encouraging an exploration of implications of points of view, including critical weighing of evidence

structuring a fertile ecosystem
  - selecting and sequencing achievable challenges, as milestones on a learning journey
  - Ensuring representing and reasoning tools are to hand to meet these challenges

feeding back on children's thinking
  - supporting self-regulation  
  - guiding recognition of milestones reached, and the connections to other milestones

StepHeader{Encourage Pupil Reasoning}

connecting  physics to the lived-in world:

- showing idealisations explicitly
- giving instances of applied thinking

providing tools for children to think with

  - exemplifying patterns of reasoning
  - co-developing representations
  
linking to other parts of physics

  - in characteristic patterns of reasoning 
  - in noticing shared physical quantities
  
showing practices of physics
  - emphasising intervention and measurement
  - revealing the role of experiments in testing ideas
  
engaging physical experiences
  - experiencing, not only seeing, physical phenomena
  - Encouraging thoughtful physical exploration


StepHeader{Activity duration}

The approximate duration is in minutes, and also presented as the slice of a notional 60-minute pie. Adapt these durations to suit local circumstances.

StepHeader{Activity types}

- teacher-led discussion
- teacher-led activity
- teacher exposition
- teacher demonstration

- small group discussion
- small group practical
- group presentations

StepHeader{Resources available to think with}

The experiences, thoughts and skills needed for each activity are potentially available due to the sequencing. (You might anticipate needing to re-activate these affordances, learning being what it is). To re-order the activities, you'll need to consider the affordances available in the new sequence.

StepHeader{Afterword â€“ just what is a QuoteThis{teachable sequence}?} 

Teachable sequences are worked out and justified imagined learning journeys, combining accounts of prototype teacher interventions, accounts of expected pupil representing and reasoning, and supporting rationale.

These are actionable narratives that illustrate, motivate and encourage teacher-activated interventions: exposition; elucidation; exploration.

The sequences are constructed as a series of interlocking strands, to provide a framework for teachers to apprehend the intention of the sequence, to enable intelligent local adaption. The rationale strand supports the teacher intervention and pupil reasoning strands. The activity strand provides an example of a workable skeleton in which to implement the teacher thinking and children reasoning strands. Such a grouping might form a teaching passage, but you'll want to configure it as a localised lesson plan to allow space for professional judgement and interpretation.

The teaching passages are an invitation to deliberative teaching experiments are deliberate variations in practice, based on evidence.

An imagined learning journey seems appropriate for teacher planning and preparation. Any child's experienced learning journey is likely to be messier, describing happenings in the mind of the child, as far as possible.
