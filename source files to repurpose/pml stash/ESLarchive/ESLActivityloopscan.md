WebTitle{What loops can do(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Use a few well-chosen examples of loops at all scales to establish the common purpose of the loops, identifying what is running-down and where power is doing something we want.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Run a discussion based on images, diagrams and laboratory experiments. Draw out and establish that loops can and do transmit power, doing useful jobs. 

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- drawn schematic diagrams linking domestic appliances to power stations on the national grid(single and multiple loops)
- a hand-held torch, with a visible circuit(use some technology to show this enlarged)
- a laboratory power supply is making a bulb glow
- a laboratory power is running a radiant heater
- a battery-powered toy that moves
- a laboratory power supply is running a motor that lifts a load when a switch is closed.

StepHeader{Happens}

Draw out the common patterns across all the examples.

- there is a complete loop
- there is some QuoteThis{running-down} at one place on the loop
- there is some QuoteThis{useful-working} at a different place on the loop
- the two places don't have to be close together

You might like to introduce this simple view of the loop.

Later the arrows will be used to represent power in watts. Now there is no need to establish that formally.
