WebTitle{The mains loop in real life(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Use images and diagrams and some appliances to relate domestic circuits to the laboratory work on loops, both electrical and rope.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Connect the work on loops in the laboratory back to the lived-in world

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a collection of images of domestic appliances
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- ValueRange{4}{5}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}

Establish the context for considering mains wiring and safety by placing it in the context of work on loops. You might start by categorising the appliances and ordering the categories by the power switched.

Show that the movement of rope past a grabbing hand still warms, even if the rope alternates, rather than flows in one direction, as an account of alternating current. 

Relate the control of power by switching or more graduated means to loops with series or parallel connections

Link high power to a large flow, and note that you don't want humans in a loop where there is a large current. It does not end well. A design for safety is a design to avoid placing humans in such a situation.
