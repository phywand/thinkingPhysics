StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Help students to re-imagine the lived-in world in a useful and simplified way.

InsertGraphic{ESLReImaginingLoopsPID}{420}{266}

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

StepHeader{Ideas students have}

PiperLink{Some younger pupils hold a QuoteThis{consumer-source} model of the simple circuit. SpacingLinebreak These pupils may think that the battery (the QuoteThis{source}) gives something to the bulb (the QuoteThis{consumer}). They may think, therefore, that a single wire from a battery terminal to a bulb terminal will be sufficient to light the bulb.}{https://spark.iop.org/some-younger-pupils-hold-consumer-source-model-simple-circuit}

PiperLink{Many students see circuit behaviour as a sequence of causes and effects, rather than seeing the whole circuit as an interacting system. SpacingLinebreak Students will often offer explanations of their predictions about what will happen when a circuit is changed in some way that is based on sequential reasoning, rather than seeing the whole circuit as an interacting system.}{https://spark.iop.org/many-pupils-see-circuit-behaviour-sequence-causes-and-effects-rather-seeing-whole-circuit}

PiperLink{Many students are confused by the idea of conventional current. SpacingLinebreak Conventional current is defined to be in the opposite direction to the QuoteThis{real} current of electrons. This difference can lead to confusion.}{https://spark.iop.org/many-pupils-are-confused-idea-conventional-current}


EEFPreconceptionsLink{The suggested sequence of activities in the lesson plan that follows helps to address these preconceptions.}

StepHeader{A sequence of activities}

ActivitySynopsis{01}{Whereâ€™s the loop?}{15}{teacher-led discussion}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivityfindloop.html}{Draw on prior experiences (both curricular and not) to establish that loops are everywhere in electrical technology. Images and circuits on the benchtop and appliances all serve to stimulate discussion. At this stage, it's useful to concentrate on circuits where power transmission is more important than transmitting information.}

EEFToolkitMetaCognitionLink{Students should be encouraged to notice what they are doing in re-imagining the world for a new purpose}

EEFLanguageScienceLink{Students moving from everyday descriptions of the lived-in world to specialised descriptions, suitable for particular purposes}

ActivitySynopsis{02}{How the loop works}{20}{small group discussion}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivityloopscan.html}{Use a discussion starter to run a small group discussion exploring children's ideas about how electrical loops work. Use the intelligence gathered to challenge the unhelpful ideas and build on the useful ideas in the remainder of the sequence.}

EEFToolkitCollaborationLink{Explaining to others, and listening to how others have understood your explanations forms a vital resource to help students know what they are thinking.}

EEFFeedbackLink{Provide reinforcement, supporting and guiding students heading along the QuoteThis{right lines} and adapt what you do to switch the direction of travel where students are heading off down the QuoteThis{wrong track}. Be very aware of student's statements that might well be little more than a recalled phrase.}

ActivitySynopsis{03}{What loops can do}{15}{teacher-led discussion}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivityhowloopworks.html}{Use a few well-chosen examples of loops at all scales to establish the common purpose of the loops, identifying what is running-down and where power is doing something we want.}

EEFToolkitMetaCognitionLink{Reflect on how the examples you've used to guide the thinking provide a framework for re-imagining the world.}

EEFPracticalWorkLink{Use the apparatus as a resource to help students make sense of talk about how loops can enable engineers to intervene reliably and physicists to develop fruitful accounts.}

EEFModellingLink{Engage students in model-building explicitly, sharing the purpose of the model as you go. Explore both the representations you have chosen and the reasoning that you expect to be able to do with those representations. Now would be a good time to be explicitly agnostic about conventional current.}

ActivitySynopsis{04}{Drawing loops}{10}{teacher exposition}{https://slowthinkingphysics.net/ESLActivitydrawingloops.html}{Work with the class to explore the representation of loops, including the canonical representation of a circuit diagram. Establish your conventions for drawing the loops, sharing reasons for those conventions.}

EEFLanguageScienceLink{Use labels alongside the diagrams to encourage appropriate precision in the use of language.}

EEFModellingLink{The circuit diagram is a model, as you can reason using this representation. Enliven this insight across several drawings, focusing mainly on the connections.}

EEFMemoryLink{Draw on previous experience of representing circuits.}

EEFFeedbackLink{Share the purposes of drawing circuits in the way that you choose as a framework to provide feedback on both prior representations used by the students, and on ways of thinking encouraged by the representations.}

StepHeader{Teacher's thinking}

{>>STARTTEACHERBLOCK<<}
Starting on the topic,  establish the loop as essential. Encourage students to think about and think with loops. Don't focus on QuoteThis{rules} about parallel and series circuits, conurbations of equations, or a hail of electrical components and meters. Physics is about seeing the wood for the trees, and the loop is the wood.

InsertGraphic{ESLLoopPowerMakeBreakPID}{550}{350}

QuoteThis{What happens} in laboratory-based circuits is a complex dynamic interplay of thermal motion of electrons, of charge differences, or resultant electrical fields and the work that they do. And, to top it all off, often of electrochemistry as well. So, here is an excellent opportunity to show physics in action by developing an intelligible model with students that is fit for purpose. The purpose is to enable students to reason confidently and accurately about electrical circuits.

To start, identify loops and focus on the use of circuits for controllable power transmission. Although not in those words.

StepHeader{Students' thinking}

{>>STARTstudentsBLOCK<<}

All electrical circuits are loops. If only I could understand a simple loop, then I'd be able to get on top of circuits.

I've got some ideas about loops, and they're not the same as other people. Some of my ideas work well; for some others, I'm not so sure.

Electrical loops are suitable for warming things, lighting things, cooking my food, mixing up food, drilling a hole, and even driving some cars, some bicycles and some trains. They are have something that runs down, not always a battery, and the loop connecting what runs down to the desired happening can be very long. And that's good. And we have control over the warming, lighting and zooming around and about.

There are many ways of drawing loops, and I'll choose the one best suited to what I want to think about or for what I want to tell other people.
