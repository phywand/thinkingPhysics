WebTitle{What we know(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Review and summarise the knowledge and competences you've developed for the students ahead of putting them to work in the design tasks.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Review:
- The need for a complete loop.
- Considering circuits with parallel connections as two independent loops
- The use of these two relationships, within each loop: FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab} ; ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- 4 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, 2 pairs of identical colour
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- - ValueRange{4}{5}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}

Reactivate the thinking students will need to meet the design challenges you're about to set. Exemplify reasoning about electrical circuits and rope loops, emphasising the role of switches in making and breaking loops.
