WebTitle{Focusing in on the idea of a loop(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Use this to reactivate the idea of a loop connecting something QuoteThis{running-down} and something else warming-up or glowing, or some other result that we want. Emphasise that you arrange loops to get a wide variety of things done. SpacingLinebreak Assemble a collection of prepared images, simple circuits on the bench top and domestic appliances to support the discussion.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Reactivate the idea of a working loop by discussing a selection of examples. Here you build a bridge from previous work, where students identified loops, laying the groundwork for modelling the loops. This modelling will enable students to reason successfully about loops, so now ensure that students can recognise such loops in a wide variety of contexts.

The activity is also an opportunity for students to find out how they think circuits work, and to find out that many other students may not agree with them.

StepHeader{Prepare}

ListEquipment
- a selection of images of loops at work, mostly electrical, but perhaps including some of the factories from the pre-electrical era, where belt drives allowed remote working to happen.
- a few working electrical everyday devices, such as a torch, a motor-driven toy
- one or two laboratory circuits, set up on the front bench
- printouts of a prompt for students to explore how they think electrical circuits work.

StepHeader{Happens}

Emphasise the phenomena that you're hoping the model-to-come will illuminate, by discussing a carefully sequenced set of examples of circuits. Don't get buried in mechanisms, and allow discussion of just enough detail to connect the samples to the lived-in world. Use the real examples and chosen images to identify loops.

Many of the unhelpful ideas that research has show students use to reason about for electric circuits reinforced by considering components one at a time rather than in a loop. For example, students might imagine that something is racing along from the battery to the component.

Show them a picture of a circuit from previous experience and ask them to draw a circuit diagram on mini-whiteboards. Checking that they are linking the physical and graphical representation of an electrical loop. (You'll recognise this retrieval practice).

Run a short small-group discussion based on the prompt to encourage students to be aware of how they do think about electrical circuits work.

TeacherSpeak{Here are the views of some students on how circuits work. Do you agree with them? Are there any that you think are wrong? What do you think?}

Establish this schematic as a common pattern.

You might link back to work on drawing loops. Suggest that having reasonable expectations(making predictions) about electric circuits depends on connecting the two arrows, and figuring out how big to draw them(As they're Sankey arrows, strictly that's the height, as this is the only dimension that denotes a value).

You'll spend a lot of time exploring predictive accounts of a simple loop, so introduce that with the arrows now.

That you can arrange electrical loops to control the power (the height of the arrows) is one reason why electrical loops are so prevalent.

TeacherSpeak{Electrical loops allow you to control the jobs that get done SymbolEmdash That's one reason why you find them everywhere, and one reason we're studying them}
