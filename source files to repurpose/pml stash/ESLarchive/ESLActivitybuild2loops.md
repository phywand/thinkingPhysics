WebTitle{Model and build two loops(small group practical)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Students work with two rope loops of a different colour to make predictions. Then test these predictions with circuit loops made with different coloured wires. So, build and test simple circuits with parallel connections.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Connect two-loop reasoning using rope loops with two-loop thinking for electrical circuits, encouraging productive reasoning about circuits with parallel connections.

StepHeader{Prepare}

Two loops of rope, of different colours( ideally matching the two colours of the pairs of wires) and lengths, but of the small diameter and construction.

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- 4 of ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, 2 pairs of identical colour
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{24}{W} bulb
- printed diagrams of a sequence of circuits to build
- ValueUnit{2}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- ValueUnit{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}

Students reasona about and then build a sequence of circuits, representing and discussing each with the aid of a rope loop.

TeacherSpeak{For this circuit here, how can you show what you expect with the rope loops?}

The idea of having a resonable expectation of what to look for when QuoteThis{doing an experiment} is rather important â€“ experiments are purposeful interventions and explorations.

TeacherSpeak{What do you expect to notice when you connect the circuit up? Has working with the rope loop suggested that's likely?} 

You'll need to guide the choice and sequence of circuits for each group, matching that to thier progress and your expectations.

TeacherTip{Apply firm encouragement where necessary, so that students reason about the loop before building it. SpacingParabreak Acting out their understanding using the rope loops. SpacingParabreak  It's what is going on in their minds that is the take home here, not simply being able to follow a sequence of instructions.}

Making connections across the sequence develops a convincing account of how to reason fruitfully about circuits with parallel connections.
