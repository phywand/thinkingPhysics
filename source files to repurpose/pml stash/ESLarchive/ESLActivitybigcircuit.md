WebTitle{The big circuit(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Use a simple circuit running right around the classroom, linking a power supply and a bulb, to reinforce the behaviour of the whole loop as a system.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Bring students' ideas out into the open through class discussion, based on a dramatic circuit.

Consolidate and challenge through discussion, around noticing that the bulb lights very quickly, even it's when a long way from the battery.

StepHeader{Prepare}

Assemble a EmphasiseThis{big}, but simple circuit with the connecting wires run right around the perimeter of the room, taped to the classroom walls.

ListEquipment
- a ValueRange{0}{12}{V} variable lab power supply
- a ValueUnit{12}{V}, ValueUnit{36}{W} bulb
- 2 of really long ValueUnit{4}{mm} leads, identical colour
- a flamboyant switch 
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal)

StepHeader{Happens}

Focus attention on the size of the EmphasiseThis{big} circuit. The class sits in the middle of a large electrical loop. Build up slowly to switching on the EmphasiseThis{big} circuit, asking the students to predict whether the bulb will light straightaway.

TeacherSpeak{What happens when the switch is closed?&hellip;  Bulb warms up and lights up.}

TeacherSpeak{What runs down?&hellip;  The fuel supply in the local power station.}

The bulb glows almost straight away, even though there is a significant distance between the battery and bulb:

TeacherSpeak{Why does it happen so quickly?}

TeacherSpeak{We can see the bulb lighting up the surroundings, and we can feel the bulb warming us if we're close enough, but we cannot see how this happens. What is going on in the EmphasiseThis{big} circuit to allow the bulb to light?}

Relate this to the rope loop and draw on the earlier small group discussions, seeding the ideas you want to revisit.
