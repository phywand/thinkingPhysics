StepHeader{Links to National Curriculum}

Pupils should be taught about: electric current, measured in amperes, in series circuits and parallel circuits, currents add where branches meet and current as flow of charge.

StepHeader{Important ideas and ways of thinking}

Encourage students to reason about loops to complete design challenges.

Essential aspects of thinking like a physicist that you might like to address in this lesson are connecting physics to the lived-in world: showing the process of idealisation; exemplifying patterns of reasoning; emphasising intervention in the exploration of the applicability of ideas; rooting the ideas in physical experiences in seeking reliability.

StepHeader{Ideas students have}

PiperLink{Few students are able to use the idea of potential to explain or predict observations about simple circuits. SpacingLinebreak  In particular, students often struggle to move beyond the idea of voltage being a measure of QuoteThis{strength of push} to the idea of it being a difference in some sort of QuoteThis{level}.}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-are-able-use-idea-potential-explain-or-predict-observations-about-simple-circuits}

PiperLink{Few students can clearly distinguish the ideas of electric current and potential difference. SpacingLinebreak  Many students see potential difference, or voltage, as a consequence of electric current, rather than a cause of it.}{https://spark.iop.org/few-pupils-can-clearly-distinguish-ideas-electric-current-and-potential-difference}

StepHeader{Teacher's thinking}

{>>STARTTEACHERBLOCK<<}
There is no new physics in this passage. Make time to consolidate, to develop confidence, to apply formative corrective feedback where needed. This consolidation can start with a review of how you're developing thinking about electric circuits with the class.
Then launch a series of challenges, each of which can be tackled by thinking about loops. The challenges can be frustrating if addressed by trial and error, and even circuit diagrams may not be the best representational tools to figure things out. Some introductory discussion, where you exemplify some possible approaches seems best.
The challenges are not all of equal difficulty, so it's best to match the selection and ordering of the challenges to the aptitude, grit and competence of the different groups.
Sharing the solutions provides an opportunity to both find out how students are reasoning, to feedback, and celebrating their growing confidence. Drawn, annotated sketches of their solutions, perhaps addressed to some imagined audience, form a sound basis for a continuing conversation. Including images of their completed circuits encourages students to build the circuits. (Experience suggests students might need firm encouragement to build and validate their proposals). 
Beyond that, short movie clips of groups explaining their solutions, or structured feedback from parents or carers after such an explanation may also work well.

StepHeader{Students' thinking}

{>>STARTstudentsBLOCK<<}
Figuring out how to map the patterns of completed or broken electrical loops onto the challenges to transmit information is the key. Students re-imagine the situations described to visualise the process as a change in the state of one or more electrical loops. Several iterations will probably end needed, and as with much exploratory design work, pencil and paper provide a flexible public space to support discussions and trials. Going large encourages collaborative tracing out of loops and group-moderated annotations. Trading proposals and reasoning allows students to see what they think.
The process is much more important than the solutions, as the take-away is the development of flexible, skilled reasoning, not canonical solutions to these particular problems.
