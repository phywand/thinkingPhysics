WebTitle{Trade-offs and power in loops(teacher-led discussion)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Considers how you can control power in loops and the consequences for mains circuits.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Show how to control power in electrical loops with both parallel and series connections, relating this to the rope loop. Re-introduce the idea of a trade-off.

StepHeader{Happens}

Set up two simple circuits, with bulbs of equal brightness but different current and voltage. Make the point that there is a choice, a QuoteThis{trade-off} between current and voltage, to achieve the same power.

Connect this to the choice of high voltage mains to avoid high currents.

Link this back to the two ways of achieving equal warming
- high pull, low flow
- Low pull, high flow
as being a QuoteThis{trade-off}, and so to:

ProductABC{power}{current}{voltage}  SymbolArrowright  ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}

If appropriate, explore similar decisions in circuits with series and parallel connections.
