WebTitle{One to two loops(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Start from to separate rope loops, which later turn out to have been driven by the same hands, as an introduction to describing circuits with parallel connections as multiple loops.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Show how circuits with parallel connections can be thought of as two separate loops, with the battery in common.

StepHeader{Prepare}

Two loops of rope, of different colours and lengths, but similar diameter and construction.

ListEquipment
- ValueRange{2}{3}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps blue
- - ValueRange{4}{5}{metre} rope loop (ValueRange{6}{9}{millimetre} diameter is ideal), perhaps green, but not also blue

StepHeader{Happens}

Start with a child on your left, functioning as a bulb in the green rope loop circuit. Run through the relationships

FractionABC{flow}{pull}{grab}

ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}

Settle on high resistance, so a strong grab for this child. Set this loop to one side.

Turn to a child on your right, the bulb for the blue rope loop. Run through the same relationship, settling on a low grab for this child. Set down the loop.

Now pick up both loops. Argue that each will continue as before since there is no change in either loop. Emphasise that the resistance (the grab) in either loop affects only the flow in that loop. Operate both loops at once, with the students maintaining their relative grabs.

Practice your action, so that you can pull equally hard on two ropes that are passing through your hands at different speeds.

Finally, bring both students onto the same side, so making the loops more like a conventional drawing of a circuit with parallel connections.
