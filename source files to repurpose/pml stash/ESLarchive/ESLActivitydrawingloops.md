WebTitle{Drawing loops(teacher exposition)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Work with the class to explore the representation of loops, including the canonical representation of a circuit diagram. Establish your conventions for drawing the loops, sharing reasons for those conventions.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Relate the conventional drawings of components and circuits to the simple loops looked at so far. Emphasise applicable conventions, and that you need to work with care when translating a diagram to a laboratory bench-top build.

StepHeader{Happens}

Start with the simple loop.

Compare this with a diagram of a conventional drawn circuit and a bench-top build of that circuit. Perhaps by drawing deliberately perverse spaghetti-like alternatives, emphasise the utility of the conventional rectangular representations.

Step through relating one to the other  SymbolEndash moving from the bench-top to the diagram and from diagram to bench-top.

Restrict yourself to batteries, bulbs, resistors, switches and wires for now. Use a convention that'll be beneficial later: that batteries, bulbs and resistors all get drawn vertically (these are where the power gets switched).
