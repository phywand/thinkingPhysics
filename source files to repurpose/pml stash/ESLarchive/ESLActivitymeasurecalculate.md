WebTitle{Measurements and calculations(teacher demonstration)}

ThinkHeader{Summary}

Show how to combine the electrical measurements of current and voltage (measured physical quantities) to figure out power and resistance(calculated physical quantities). Relate both measured and calculated quantities to the rope loop model.

StepHeader{Purpose}

Show how to combine the electrical measurements of current and voltage to calculate power and resistance.

StepHeader{Happens}

Use a simple circuit, built first, and then with the ammeter and voltmeter connected in afterwards. Talk the process of placing the meters into the circuit.

Combine the measured values to calculate the resistance and then the power, making your working very clear (quantity algebra).

Exploit the connections between the rope loops and the electrical loops to ensure that the calculations are meaningful:

ProductABC{power}{current}{voltage}  SymbolArrowright  ProductABC{warming}{flow}{pull}
