- natural motion
- unnatural motion
- relative motions
- interactions modelled with forces
- quantities of motion
- force changes motion
- invariants and conservation laws

### Fm01—Resultant force sets acceleration

- FractionABC{acceleration}{force}{mass} as  the preferred form.
- force changes motion-it's not needed to keep something going
- quantifying  contact forces

## Written summary for Force and motion

A well chosen single force acting on a mass can replace the action of many other forces. This resultant force causes the motion of that mass to change. For an accelerated mass,  the time-trace of successive locations, the worldline of the mass, alters in response to the action of the force (FractionABC{QuantitySymbol{a}}{QuantitySymbol{F}}{QuantitySymbol{m}}: Newton's second law). If there is no such change then there is no resultant force (Newton’s first law).

Careful analysis of a situation as a mass is isolated allows a radical simplification. Each physical interaction of the mass with its surroundings are replaced with an appropriately labelled arrow, summarising the effect of the interaction and representing a force. Interactions due to gravity, electric charges and magnetic charges are replaced by non-contact forces: Buoyancy, distortion, grip, slip and drag interactions are replaced by contact forces.

The acceleration, caused by this resultant force, tells the velocity how to change. The velocity in turn tells the displacement how to change. These accumulations enable prediction of the worldline: how the mass traverses space. One can also work backwards, inferring the velocities and accelerations from a knowledge of the positions and times.

Forces not lying along one line can still be added. If the force is always at right angles to the velocity then the resulting path of the mass is a circle; if the force is always in one direction, not that of the initial motion, then the path is a parabola.

The quantity of motion an object possesses depends on its mass and velocity. How to combine these two to give the most useful measure was the subject of a significant debate. Now there are two measures: the momentum and the energy shifted to the kinetic store. Momentum changes in response to the accumulation of force acting over time; energy is shifted by the mechanical pathway: an accumulation of power over time. Algebra and careful thinking about the units reveal rich connections between different measures of motion. Gravity can provide the force driving the changes down this mechanical pathway, so filling or emptying a gravity store. Now calculations can be done to show how much energy shifts between stores.

Isolating an object and condensing it to a point mass, to model its motion by considering the forces acting on it, leaves the rest of the universe as other objects, on which the modelled mass exerts forces. Since each separate physical interaction results in a force on the mass, and the converse is true, each interaction is replaced with a force pair. Half of the pair acts on the modelled mass; the other half on the object exerting this force. These two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, as a result of representing the same interaction on two different objects (Newton’s third law).

If there are only two objects it follows that the accumulation of the effect of one force is equal and opposite to the effect of the second force on the other . So the two objects can exchange momenta, but not create or destroy it. Momentum is conserved.
