WebTitle{An outline of the ideas in the Motion topic}


### Motion topic—core ideas

- calculations and graphical representations connected
- relative motion is the only motion
- resultant force changes motion

### Mo01—Speed

- depends on a point of view
- averages and instantaneous speeds
- units are important, to define physical quantities

### Mo02—Resultant force zero predicts constant speed

- natural motion in the absence of forces
- constant motion requires no force
- resultant forces

### Mo03—Resultant non-zero predicts changes in speed

- a resultant force changes motion
- driving and retarding forces
- positive and negative accelerations
- accumulations

### Written summary for the topic

Noticing a motion, perhaps something approaching or receding from you depends on you taking a point of view. So all motion is relative motion: there are changes relative to a location—in both position(distance) and in clock time(duration). The rate of change of distance with duration is speed. Often we don't mention the point of view, but it's always there and sometimes this omission can cause difficulties.

Motion is changed by the action of a resultant force. Calculate the resultant force acting on the object by adding together all of the force arrows that have been identified as being exerted tend by the environment, acting on the object. The change in motion of the object is proportional to this force. If this were not so, then the study of forces would not be so important. Together with the mass of the object the resultant force determines the acceleration: this may set the change in speed in each unit of time.

You can invert this line of reasoning: make several measurements of the speed, see if it changes, and use that as a hint to see if there is a resultant force acting on the object. This result may drive a search for more forces exerted by the environment
