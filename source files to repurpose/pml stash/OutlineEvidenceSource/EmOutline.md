## Written summary for Electromagnetism

Magnetic fields exist in volumes of space around either permanent magnets or current carrying wires. They represent volumes of space where placing a magnetic material will result in a force acting on that object, exerted by the source of the magnetic field. So fields are the medium by which action at a distance is supported: one might see them as the way in which the magnet reaches out and touches the magnetic material.

As these forces are large enough to feel with objects that you can manipulate (unlike the other two examples of non-contact forces: gravity and electrical) a detailed study of the shapes of the  fields and the resulting forces is a good place to come to understand non-contact forces. Such a detailed study is carried out using techniques to reveal the shape of the  field: compasses and iron  filings.

Some technological exploitations of these non-contact forces make the effects seem more real: the bell, relay and motor are amongst the most common.
