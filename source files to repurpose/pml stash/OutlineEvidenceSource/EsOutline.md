## Written summary for Earth in Space

The Earth is our home. We have managed to piece together quite a lot about its movement by careful analysis of the observational evidence. The Earth both spins on its own axis and orbits the Sun. These two motions can be used to account for day and night and the seasons.

Day and night and the daily apparent movement of the Sun are explained by the rotation of the Earth on its own axis once every 24 hours, so presenting a continuously changing aspect to the Sun. Discovering that planets and our own moon also spin on their own axis allows us to define day length for these objects also.

Finding that the Moon orbits Earth extends this account to cover the phases of the Moon, and of Venus. So far all has been explained by distinguishing between luminous and non-luminous bodies; using the fact that light travels in straight lines; and thinking about the relative placement and orientation of the different spheres which model the Sun, Moon and Earth. But to explain so much with so little produces hard explanations, with quite a few steps in each, so this is not the place to start teaching.

Even through the seasons our home maintains a small range of temperatures, a constant atmosphere, and conditions conducive to life for a wide range of organisms. These live on a very thin shell between the crust and the top of the atmosphere. Other planets have their own distinct atmospheres, with very different compositions, pressures and temperatures, often lying on top of the planetary surface. The quantity of atmosphere and its density depend both on the gravitational force, so on the mass of the planet, and on the gases that make up the atmosphere. The planet itself can also be made from different phases of matter: some are almost entirely gas, others have liquid on the surface, still others are almost entirely solid. These differences are interesting and support speculation about the origins of the solar system. Also shedding light on these origins are other astronomical objects: asteroids; meteoroids and comets.

All things fall towards planets under the action of gravity alone, a force with infinite range. So things thrown sideways above an astronomical object also fall towards the surface of the object: in each second they move a certain distance sideways, fixed by the throwing speed, and a certain distance downwards, fixed by the gravitational force. If the two distances moved have appropriate values, then the object may be in a stable orbit. You have to choose the correct orbital speed for each different distance from the planet, as the gravitational force decreases with distance. Even so, there can be two kinds of orbits: geostationary and polar. A geostationary satellite, as its name suggests, sits over one point on the Earth as it takes 24 hours to complete one orbit (actually over the equator), whilst a polar satellite loops much more rapidly round and round the Earth, over the poles. Satellites in these two kinds of orbits are put to very different uses.

Planets have natural satellite: moons—as does the Sun: planets. So a year for each planet depends on its distance from the Sun, as those further out have a smaller gravitational force acting on them due to the Sun, so fall less distance, so need to be travelling more slowly, and around a larger circumference of orbit.
