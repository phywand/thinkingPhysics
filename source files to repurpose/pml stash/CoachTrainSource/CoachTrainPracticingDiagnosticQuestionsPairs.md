WebTitle: Practicing probing â€“ Diagnostic questions

ThinkHeader{Comment} 

- Particularly in force and motion and in electric circuits, there are a good collection of diagnostic questions, developed to explore a deep qualitative, or semiquantitative, understanding of the topics.
- In other topics, where predictive theories are not so well established in elementary teaching, there is a dearth of such questions.
- Focussing on the right answers to questions can be seen as threatening, and may reinforce their picture of physics as a branch of mathematics where the answers are either obviously right or obviously wrong.

ThinkHeader{Task as such a small group of teachers}

- Agree on the answers to the questions.
- Share your confidence in your judgements and the reasoning

- Reflect on the process of doing the task, drawing out two ways in which this might probe what teachers think effectively.
- Identify concerns that you have about deploying this way of probing teacher's knowledge and understanding.
