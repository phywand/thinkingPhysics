ThinkHeader{Comment}

- This is 15 minute activity for three people, repeated 3 times, for a total duration of 45 minutes.
- One person plays the part of the coach, one the part of the perplexed teacher, and the third is an observer who will provide feedback. There are three 15 minute scenarios, each triggered by teacher question. As there are three, each person will engage with all three roles.

ThinkHeader{Task}

- For each scenario, take a clear eight minutes during which the coach and perplexed teacher are in-role, enacting a coaching scenario (observer to keep time, and reflect on what they see and hear).
- In the remaining seven minutes, feedback is provided, and then the three participants each record what they learn from that particular scenario.

### Scenario one

TeacherSpeak{Whenever I discuss the motion of thrown objects, I'm always tempted to have four force arrows on the objects, and so are my classes.}

### Scenario two

TeacherSpeak{What is the difference between rules and laws? For example we have and Ohmâ€™s Law and the rules about currents splitting at junctions in circuits. Are either laws or rules of any use for explaining what's going on?}

### Scenario three

TeacherSpeak{I'm really confused about the vibration store when I speak about energy. Surely this is either a kinetic store, or a gravity store.}
