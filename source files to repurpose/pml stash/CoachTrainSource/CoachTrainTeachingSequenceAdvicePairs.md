WebTitle: Advice about teaching sequences

Comment: This is a more extended activity (only 30 minutes!) during which you ought to make time to reflect on what advice you would give and why you would give that advice. In both cases, it's rather important to be explicit. Therefore the word ‘logical’, or any just synonyms, is banned (All too often is is used an act of intimidation – to say in effect that I think this is obvious).

Task as teacher: You working pairs, writing a collaborative document in three columns. The first column presents the sequencing of the ideas that you suggest. The second column presents the reasoning  behind that sequence, and the third column shows how you think elements of the sequence might satisfy the four facets of delivering physics courteously (Making physics connect, Providing tools to think with, Making explicit links, Exploiting physical experiences) as a simple four point scale(0-4). You might arrange things so that the reasoning enables others to tell why you have allocated the score. Set up your sheet lie this:

What to do / Why to do that now/ MPC:0-4/PTT:0-4/MEL:0-4/EPE:0-4

Reflection 1 for future action:
Reflection 2 for future action:

After this period of thinking and writing you will be asked to share with the whole group the two lessons that you will take forward to your future planning for coaching.


TeacherSpeak{I have to move from teaching about circuits with series connections to teaching about circuits with parallel connections. What's the best way to do this?}

LineBreak

TeacherSpeak{I have to introduce the idea of power dissipated and electrical circuits. I'm a bit confused about the best way to go about doing this.}

LineBreak

TeacherSpeak{I have to introduce the idea of drag forces. How do I draw the arrows, and how do I decide whether to draw an arrow?}

LineBreak

TeacherSpeak{Teaching about force and motion seems so counterintuitive. If I stop pushing something, it just stops moving. So how do I get children to think about the universe as being Newtonian?}

LineBreak

TeacherSpeak{How do I first introduced the idea of energy, so that the important ideas come naturally to my classes?}

LineBreak

TeacherSpeak{How do I make the connection between energy resources and always talk about energy stores?}
