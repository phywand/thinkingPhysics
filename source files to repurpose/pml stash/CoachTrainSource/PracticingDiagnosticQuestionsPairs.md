WebTitle: Practicing probing – Diagnostic questions

ThinkHeader{Comment} 

- Particularly in force and motion and in electric circuits, there are a good collection of diagnostic questions, developed to explore a deep qualitative, or semiquantitative, understanding of the topics.
- In other topics, where predictive theories are not so well established in elementary teaching, there is a dearth of such questions.
- Focussing on the right answers to questions can be seen as threatening, and may reinforce their picture of physics as a branch of mathematics where the answers are either obviously right or obviously wrong.

- Agree on the answers to the questions.

- Reflect on the process of doing the task, drawing out two ways in which this might probe what teachers think effectively, and to concerns that you have about deploying this way of probing teacher's knowledge and understanding.
