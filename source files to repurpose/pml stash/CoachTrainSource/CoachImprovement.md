WebTitle: Getting better as a coach

This focuses very much on the coaching physics, rather than these softer skills of managing schools, managing people, and establishing relationships. That's not to diminish the importance of these aspects of the job but just to indicate the limitations of this document.

### Making improvements

There are two intertwined strands to improving as a coach: representing physics helpfully, courteously, and precisely; engaging teachers with thinking about interpreting the physics to their children.

These two strands are already present in the coaching document:

URLLinkPN{a view of coaching}{http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CoachSupport/pml/DocShow.html?file=http://supportingphysicsteaching.net/CoachSupport/advicesource/CoachingView.md}

On engaging teachers you will need to establish a balance between probing, showing and telling appropriate to the group of teachers with whom you are working, bearing in mind always that these will be graduates. 

ThinkHeader{Probe}

Find out what's known and what is unknown—QuoteThis{probe-how}.
Use non-threatening, but often challenging and always engaging, stimuli to explore participants understanding.

ThinkHeader{Show}

Enact, exemplify and so enliven a piece of teaching—QuoteThis{show-how}. Act out a real teaching episode, wrapping it in a meta-level discussion that contextualises and enriches, but never replaces, the real action.

ThinkHeader{Tell}

Advise: share moderated experience and insight from research and implementations—QuoteThis{tell-how}.

In all three respectful engagement is the key.

In representing physics, you will need to consider the four facets:

ThinkHeader{Making physics connect}

* to children's concerns, respecting gender and ethnicity
* to the lived-in world.

ThinkHeader{Providing tools to think with}

* representing and reasoning to enable children to make predictions
* use calculation and semi-qualitative reasoning

ThinkHeader{Making explicit links}

* to children's existing ideas
* to future learning pathways
* To future possible lives
* to other topics in physics
* to other disciplines

ThinkHeader{Exploiting physical experiences}

* sensing (physicists both notice and record)
* intervening (physicists prepare situations skilfully, coaxing nature to reveal her hidden patterns in reproducible ways)

Having these in mind that teaching physics should include these four facets will allow you to give them due weight  when planning a session or sequence.

### On making progress

Coaching sits in a framework of continuing professional development: so to get better as a coach is to enable teachers to better perform in the classroom. Everything we know about CPD suggests that one off sessions, however charismatic, are not effective in changing classroom practice. Face to face sessions can only stand as a means to trigger and support the teachers through this process of continuing their professional development, simply because such sessions are rare and very time-constrained. 

So it’s not only what happens during the sessions, but also the guidance that you provide for continuing engagement before and after the sessions that will determine the effectiveness of the coaching. Such a realistic yet high-demand model of coaching makes it very hard to objectively measure the effectiveness of such coaching. Nevertheless, engaged practice has found that seeking a balance across the three elements of coaching, together with a developing representation of the physics and assaying the appropriate guidance for further engagement provides a reasonable measure against which you can assess your progress as a coach.

To assess progress as a coach therefore you need to consider all three steps across a coaching intervention:

- the preparation and planning for a session, perhaps including preparation by the teachers
- the execution of the session, which may legitimately be very different from what was planned for, but which will have a stronger reliance on the preparation
- further guidance provided in order for teachers to continue their professional development

Across these three you can then consider balance between probing, showing and telling and the selection and range of techniques deployed in each of these elements. You can also consider the extent to which you facilitate the teachers engaging with their own understanding of the four facets of representing physics courteously, again bearing in mind the selection and range of techniques used. Both the selection and the range of techniques will be informed by professional experience and expertise, including resources not dependent on your own immediate experience.

### Assaying progress

Simple numeric estimates will probably help to assay progress. At least making such judgments opens up the qualities for reflection.

In seeking a balanced view of how you are developing as a coach, we do think it's important to consider all three steps and not to rely on the immediate reactions(whether yours or the teachers) to the face-to-face sessions. It may also be best  to  adopt some kind if moving-point average across a number of coaching interventions.

### On style and constraints

There will be pressures to provide quick wins or quick fixes. You will need to establish balance between offering useful approaches which are immediately applicable, and therefore earn you credibility, yet still provide pointers towards deeper learning, and more challenging and engaging reflection on what it is to help young people understand how to do physics. So to keep on treating teacher as graduate professionals.

I think it's rather important to remember that the apparent simplicity in physics is rather hard won and that it depends on a large number of often hidden moves to navigate from the everyday lived-in world to the physicists world which is highly conceptual, being populated with semiotically charged representations (of which words are just one mode).  Neither biology nor chemistry provide a simple algorithmic set of ways to teach, and there is no obvious reason to be forced into such an approach for physics, whatever the folk wisdom on that matter. If teaching is truly more than either delivering or telling, then a dialogic approach that requires a deeper understanding on the part of the teacher seems essential.

### Afterword

Coaching is all about encouraging slow thinking in physics(STP). That is attentive, deliberative and effortful thinking. 

Flow and expertise come later: in any case, they may, in the very nature of being apparently effortless, impede the progress of the less expert if held up as a a practice on which the less expert might  apprentice themselves.
