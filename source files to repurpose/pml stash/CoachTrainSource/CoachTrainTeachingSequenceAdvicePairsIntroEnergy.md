WebTitle: Advice about teaching sequences

ThinkHeader{Scenario} 

- This is a more extended activity (a valuable  30 minutes!) during which you ought to make time to reflect on what advice you would give and why you would give that advice, in this situation:

TeacherSpeak{How do I first introduce the idea of energy, so that the important ideas come naturally to my classes?} 

- In both cases it's rather important to be explicit. Therefore the word QuoteThis{logical}, or any synonym, is banned (All too often this is used an act of intimidation â€“ to say in effect that I think this is obvious).

ThinkHeader{Task as a coach}

- You work in pairs, writing a collaborative document in three columns.
- The first column presents the sequencing of the ideas that you suggest.
- The second column presents the reasoning  behind that sequence.
- The third column shows how you think elements of the sequence might satisfy the four facets of presenting a respectful picture pf physics as a simple four point scale(0-4).
Here is a reminder of these four facets

Making physics connect(MPC)

* to children's concerns
* to the lived-in world.

Providing tools to think with(PTT)

* representing and reasoning to enable children to make predictions
* use calculation and semi-qualitative reasoning

Making explicit links(MEL

* to children's existing ideas
* to future learning pathways
* to other topics in physics
* to other disciplines

Exploiting physical experiences(EPE)

* sensing (physicists both notice and record)
* intervening (physicists prepare situations skilfully, coaxing nature to reveal her hidden patterns in reproducible ways)

- You might  arrange things so that the reasoning enables others to tell why you have allocated the score.
- After this period of thinking and writing you will be asked to share with the whole group the two lessons that you will take forward to your future planning for coaching. So please write clearly


Set up your sheet like this, in 3 columns:

What to do / Why to do that now/ MPC:0-4  PTT:0-4  MEL:0-4  EPE:0-4

With space for the two feedback Items at the bottom.
