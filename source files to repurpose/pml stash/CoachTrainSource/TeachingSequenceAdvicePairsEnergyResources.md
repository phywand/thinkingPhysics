WebTitle: Advice about teaching sequences

ThinkHeader{Comment} 

This is a more extended activity (a valuable  30 minutes!) during which you ought to make time to reflect on what advice you would give and why you would give that advice. In both cases, it's rather important to be explicit. Therefore the word ‘logical’, or any just synonyms, is banned (All too often is is used an act of intimidation – to say in effect that I think this is obvious).

ThinkHeader{Task as a coach}

You working pairs, writing a collaborative document in three columns. The first column presents the sequencing of the ideas that you suggest. The second column presents the reasoning  behind that sequence, and the third column shows how you think elements of the sequence might satisfy the four facets of delivering physics courteously (Making physics connect, Providing tools to think with, Making explicit links, Exploiting physical experiences) as a simple four point scale(0-4). You might arrange things so that the reasoning enables others to tell why you have allocated the score. Set up your sheet lie this:

What to do / Why to do that now/ MPC:0-4/PTT:0-4/MEL:0-4/EPE:0-4

Reflection 1 for future action:
Reflection 2 for future action:

After this period of thinking and writing you will be asked to share with the whole group the two lessons that you will take forward to your future planning for coaching.
