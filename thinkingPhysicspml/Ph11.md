Photons don't even know to QuoteThis{travel} in straight lines. However if there is nothing between the source and detector, light appears to travel in straight lines. So next you might try looking at lining-up and curling-up for a source and detector with nothing in the space separating them. Again you have to guess – but an intelligent guess – as to the most significant paths and then model that with the triplets.

Here only the contributions from the central area add much to the resultant – contributions from paths with waypoints far from the centre line curl up. Again you have recovered an empirical law: that light travels in straight lines. But once again you now have a theoretical reason why this is the case – it's no longer just to be accepted as fact.

But there is a wrinkle, which you can explore. It does look as if you can ignore all paths apart from those defined by a hole around the centreline. A commonly fruitful way of thinking in physics is to take things to extremes – so now try making the hole smaller by adding a barrier. In two dimensions on screen that will be a slit.
