Principles for developing an energy description:

1. Any such description depends on a clear physical description, using discipline-specific quantities, of a phenomenon in the lived-in world. Such physical descriptions may include mechanisms but should not invoke "energy".

   "Energy: not a mechanism; not tangible."

2. Any such description must be purposeful: the description should be capable of yielding insight.

   "Only describe with energy where this yields insight."

3. Energy is conserved and dissipated, and changes calculated in various ways but is just energy: qualifying adjectives are unhelpful.

   "Energy is just energy."

4. A description constrains possible processes but does not predict whether a process happens, or explain how a process happens.

   "Energy insights reveal impossibilities: what could happen; not what does happen."

5. An energy description represents a radical simplification, well-matched for describing some, but not all processes.

   "Where energy helps, the description is simple."

Avoiding this advice might lead to several missteps.
