# WebTitle{Systems: rope loops all the way}

So it's rope loops all the way, for those students without algebraic fluency. Because a workable didactical transposition of a system-led approach for a tactile audience, pre-quantitative reasoning students exists and works. And maybe even for those with algebraic fluency, to support their physical intuition, as you can engage psychological primitives, and act-out your understanding to develop predictions.
