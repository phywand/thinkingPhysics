# WebTitle{Seeing as the higher-ups see}

Alice is free-falling past a pair of Bobs. Alice passes the first more slowly than the second - that’s free-fall towards a mass. Alice will notice the first clock ticking more slowly than the second, and both ticking more slowly than her clock(moving clocks tick more slowly, a connection can be made here). As everyone in free-fall will with agree with Alice, this is something about the geometry near a mass. Represent this variation in the space-time geometry with appropriately tilted light cones. You’re getting closer to being able to draw representations of space-time.
