# WebTitle{A didactical path: Imitation and delay}

## StepHeader{Starting out}

First I’d suggest developing the idea of a wave slowly and carefully, with the building blocks as:

1.  imitation of what is happening at the source,
2.  after a delay,
3.  depending on distance from the source.

## StepHeader{One to many mimics}

Such an episode moves from a single imitator (mimic, copy-cat) to an array of imitators at different distances. These represent the medium, and arranging them regularly gives a recognisable conventional representation of a wave. The gain is that now children know what the component parts are and how they work together to give this overall pattern.

## StepHeader{Different pattens}

Then launch into an episode exploring different patterns of motion in the source, still imposing a delay on the imitators depending on their distance from the source. This is the imperative, expressed as a memorable slogan: ”do like me, but later”. The imitators now show a variety of waveforms, and the sequence reinforces the essential component facets of what it is to be a wave.

## StepHeader{Pulses and packets}

Not all sources vibrate continuously, so launch into the a third episode moving from a single delayed imitation, to pulses, to wave packets, and back to continuous waves.
