## StepHeader{Three levels of description}

1. Describe a physical process

2. Quantify, then perhaps develop an explanatory mechanism

3. Generate an energy account

The third question is not an energy description - it belongs to a different semiotic register - although it may be useful in identifying calculations that might be insightful, and so denote fruitful qualitative descriptions in identifying stores and pathways. That's the last you'll see of mechanisms here.

(Because power is about what's happening, it's easier to connect to the lived-in world, and perhaps move from that into discussions of mechanisms. Power and energy might be co-developed, as opportunities for their natural use occur, rather than developing at first one, and then the other.)
