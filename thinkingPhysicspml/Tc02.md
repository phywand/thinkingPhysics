# WebTitle{How do you draw circuits?}

## StepHeader{ZZZ}

Circuit diagrams are amongst the most abstract representations used in elementary physics teaching. How best to support reasoning with them, and indeed, what kinds of reasoning do you want to support? Or, more succinctly, how do you prepare to answer the question "Why are we doing this, miss?" Diagrams play a significant supporting role in reasoning about circuit loops, so starting with thinking about choices made, even after deciding to use conventional symbols, may be productive.

Is there a good convention for how to orientate the drawing of a circuit (leave aside for the moment the process of introducing representations)? After all, even for a simple circuit, there are many possibilities.

Many ways of orienting a simple circuit

I suggest a good reason for the importance of circuits is that it gives insight into switching power, which is what we use circuits at all scales for remote (electrical) working in the everyday lived-in world. You may have other reasons, which will lead you to different conclusions.

If switching power, and reasoning about power is central, then drawing the dissipative elements those where power is switched) vertically enables the representations of power to be arranged fruitfully.
