# WebTitle{Clocks ticking at different rates}

Alice notices Bob drifting past with a co-moving clock ticking away. The universal speed is the universal speed, but Alice notices that the pulse has to cover a greater distance between collisions with the mirror.

The geometry of the light paths revealed, ready for the arguments about why there should be different rates of ticking, based on universal speed and the different distances to be traversed between the mirrors. Here you have the resources to account for why moving clocks go slow, and so why time passes at different rates . This will have an effect on the light cones, so on the geometry of space-time.

But that’s not all – closer to a mass, clocks tick more slowly; durations are longer. Expect this to have a different effect on the geometry.

{++ -\> So need to have two ways of reasoning what we might see if we were the other local witness: for changing speed or changing gravity. ++}
