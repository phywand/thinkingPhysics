# WebTitle{Threshold effects}

For many processes the photon just needs to be more than a threshold value to permit the process to occur: any energy not directly enabling the process can be shifted to other stores. For example in photo-emission, energy above the threshold is shifted to the kinetic store of the emitted particle.
