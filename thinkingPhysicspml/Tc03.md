Current or charge flow (as shown here) are the same everywhere in the loop, so these are not a determinant of the orientation.

Components, other than wires and switches, are best drawn vertical in introductory teaching.

That prepares the way for reasoning about where the power gets switched, and how much, in circuits with both series and parallel connections.

Circuits with parallel connections

Reasoning about the power switched and about the depletion of the battery is well supported by the arrangement of the arrows.

Circuits with series connections

Here potential difference also appears, again reasoning about the relative values benefits from the dissipative elements arranged vertically.
