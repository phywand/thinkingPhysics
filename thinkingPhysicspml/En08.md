preparing the ground for energy

Well, we now have an image of a description; how can we prepare the ground?

1. Foregrounding constraint relationships – those which show possibilities and impossibilities – for changes where the quantities are less abstract(so level two).

2. Developing the idea of a trade-off, thus establishing that there may be choices in getting a job done, but there are hard limits to those choices.

3. Developing a semi-quantitative description for the calculated stored quantity that is energy (and maybe also a linked version for power).

This last one is reasonably well-rehearsed and tested, mainly through the influence of the supporting physics teaching initiative.
