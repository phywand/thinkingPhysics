### ThinkHeader{Step 4}

Manipulating the representations by adding arrows, as here, enables children to reason about what will happen. This set of arrows predict a track, made of track segments, as before.

These predictive stories rely on 'velocity telling displacement how to change' (less demotically: velocity accumulates displacement). This is the first tautology of the pair that comprise kinematics.

Here you are also re-creating the QuoteThis{stories of journeys}, so linking back to the lived-world. These predictions have demonstrable utility.
