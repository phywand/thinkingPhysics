# WebTitle{Drawing with code}

And how do you draw them? Freehand, using pre-made symbols in a drawing package, photocopying?

As an aside these are drawn with code, which encapsulates the complexity of the arrangement of curves to construct a simple circuit containing a bulb to:

circuitSimple("bulb")
Just as concepts in physics can be compressive, so can code. Familiarity in either case determines utility!

Perhaps you consider this worry about orientation should be binned as an example of "marginal gains ". Perhaps so, but one child's marginal gain may be another child's tripwire. And there is plenty of evidence that there are a lot of confounding patterns of reasoning about electric circuits out there. Ours not to make the learning journey any harder than necessary.
