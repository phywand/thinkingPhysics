# Introducing light cones
The region of space from which events can influence you, or which you can influence, depends on the duration you allow for, due to the universal speed, often referred to as the speed of light.

From now on, only having three dimensions to represent in, and allocating one of those to time, restrict space to two dimensions. So what were spheres of influence become discs of influence - events happening on these discs can influence Alice.

Stack the (thinly sliced) discs and you get a cone. This one shows the influence from the past: Combine it with another (flipped in the xy plane, so reaching into the future) to show events that could be influenced, and you get a light cone.

Alice, Bob and Charlie all have their own light cones - there are only local witnesses - and these may or may not notice common events, depending on the separations of Alice, Charlie and Bob and the duration you consider.
