Electrical circuits are pervasive, so there is a reliance on the technologies enabled by electric loops. Electrical loops are everywhere because of the controllability of power switching by these loops. So an additional facet to emphasise in teaching electrical circuits is this switching.

Then there are two clear supporting reasons to draw on when faced with the question, "Why are we doing this, miss?". Prepare, to frame the possible answers to such enquiries. Just in case the national curriculum in your country has not provided a clear rationale.
