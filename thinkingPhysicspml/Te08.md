# WebTitle{Preparing the ground for thinking with energy}

## StepHeader{Tilth}

Well, we now have an image of a description; how can we prepare the ground?

1. Foregrounding constraint relationships – those which show possibilities and impossibilities – for changes where the quantities are less abstract.
   (Showing what is necessary for a sound level two description).

2. Developing the idea of a trade-off, thus establishing that there may be choices in getting a job done, but there are hard limits to those choices.
   (A gentle introduction to conservation laws: not getting something for nothing.)

3. Developing a semi-quantitative description for the calculated stored quantity that is energy (and maybe also a linked version for power).
   (Laying up resources for developing a level three description for students whose algebraic and arithmetic competence is limited)

This last one is reasonably well-rehearsed and tested, mainly through the influence of the Supporting Physics Teaching initiative.
