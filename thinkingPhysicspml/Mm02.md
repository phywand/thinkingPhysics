- Climate change image, leading to models, especially feedback.

Some of the more pressing and worrying images of our time concern climate change, and what the future holds.

This is all about predictions, something that "thinking like a physicist" ought to be able to make a significant contribution to. So maybe, just maybe, we might be able to offer some insight into climate models. And we'd need some precision in representing the essential patterns, both in reasoning and in the outputs, without getting bogged down in numbers or arithmetic, if we're to communicate the essence of a contribution. So, here is a bit of a preamble sketching out a couple of essential patterns in reasoning, shared with mathematics, and how one might represent these.
