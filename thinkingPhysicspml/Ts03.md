Events for the local witness that is Alice can only occur in her light cone: this is her space-time, used to give the ‘where’ and ‘when’ of events. Alice inhabits her cone, and only her cone.

Alice the observer may record, as well as notice. But she can only do so in her space-time - she cannot step outside of it. Bob could do likewise, but only in his space-time: he is another local witness. So could Charlie. There are only local witnesses. Combine this constraint, which is the result of the universal speed, with the requirement that physics is universal and you’re well on the way to understanding’relativity’. The last step is to figure out how what Alice records will appear to Charlie, or to Bob.

## PoV practice with cones

Time to get physical: a set of 3D printed cones can be manipulated to explore what different local witnesses would notice, both within their own cones and how other cone ‘inhabitants’ might report.
Manipulating multiple cones might be used to pose questions about tilting cones and how this might affect what is noticed and recorded.
