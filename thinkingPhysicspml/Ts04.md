# 04 Reliable ticking clocks

A standard light clock, as the universal speed provides a reliable basis for generating ticks. Reliable ticking is the basis for measurement, so start by constructing a reliable clockâ€“ a pulse of light bouncing between mirrors

A clock with a variable separation of the mirrors, to further illuminate the workings of the clock. Constant (universal) speed and increased separation of mirrors reduces the tick rate.

Note [[SI units of time and distance]]time is just more fundamental?
